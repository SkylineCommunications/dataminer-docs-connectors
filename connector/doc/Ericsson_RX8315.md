### Web Interface Page

This page contains a link to the web page of the actual device. Note that the client machine has to be able to access the device, as otherwise it will not be possible to open the web interface.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The **1.1.0.x** connector range of the Ericsson RX8315 protocol supports the usage of DCF and can only be used on a DMA with **8.5.8.5** as the minimum version.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

### Interfaces

#### Fixed interfaces

Physical fixed interfaces:

- **SAT Input 1**: A single fixed interface of type **input**.
- **SAT Input 2**: A single fixed interface of type **input**.
- **SAT Input 3**: A single fixed interface of type **input**.
- **SAT Input 4**: A single fixed interface of type **input**.
- **ASI Input**: A single fixed interface of type **input**.
- **ASI Output 1**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **ASI Output 2**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **IP Output 1**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **IP Output 2**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

- Between **\[SAT Input x -\> ASI Output y\]** and **\[SAT Input x -\> IP Output z\],** where **x** is the value of the **Input RF** parameter, **y** will assume values of 1 and 2, and **z** is the **Output Port** **IP Index** that has a **UP Link Status**.
- Between **\[ASI Input-\> ASI Output y\]** and **\[ASI Input -\> IP Output z\],** where **y** will assume values of 1 and 2, and **z** is the **Output Port** **IP Index** that has a **UP Link Status**.

## Notes

Because of the versatility of the equipment, not all parameters will be filled in. If, for instance, your device is only IP-based, the Sat options will not be filled in.
