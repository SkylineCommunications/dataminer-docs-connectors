# COX Vecima R-PHY Monitor

The Cox Vecima R-PHY Monitor connector communicates with COX's Vecima R-PHY Apigee API to fetch information on managed remote PHY devices. The information of the PHY cores is displayed in tables, depending on the configured settings.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination. Default port: *443*.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy*.

### Initialization

To make sure the connector can connect to the API, specify the **API Key** and **RPM Server IP** on the Configuration page.

## How to use

The connector contains a number of settings that allow you to customize its behavior:

- **Interface Settings**: A toggle button allows you to enable/disable the **polling from an interface (HTTP)**. You can also specify an interval to configure **how frequently the interface will be polled**. Finally, you can also select which of the following operating modes should be used:

  - **Distributed**: Only requests data associated with elements hosted by the same DataMiner Agent.
  - **Centralized**: Requests data associated with all elements within the DMS.
  - **Generic**: Request all data from the interface. Import/export logic does not apply.

- **Entity Export/Import Settings**: These sections handle the exporting of configuration files and importing of provisioning files.
  You can:

  - **Enable/disable** the exporting/importing feature with the toggle buttons **Entity Export** and **Entity Import**, respectively.
  - Configure the path where files will be exported and imported, with the **Entity Export Directory** and **Entity Import Directory** parameters.
  - Select whether to export/import to a local or to a remote location with the toggle buttons **Entity Export Directory Type** and **Entity Import Directory Type**, respectively.
    Note that for the **remote** file handling feature to work, you need to enter the credentials for the system in the **System Credentials** section, and enter the path to the remote directory in the **Entity Export/Import Directory** parameter. The **path** **must be shared/accessible**.
  - Manually perform the export/import by clicking the **Apply** button in the respective section.
