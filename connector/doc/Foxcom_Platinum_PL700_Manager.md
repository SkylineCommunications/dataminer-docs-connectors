# Foxcom Platinum PL700 Manager

## About

The Foxcom Platinum PL700 provides comprehensive management and control for all Sat-Light/Platinum fiber-optic cards, redundancy switches, power supplies, and communication cards.

This connector can be used to manage and control a Foxcom Platinum PL700 Manager system. It communicates with the device using an SNMP connection to retrieve operational data and issue control commands.

The connector provides access to information for managed fiber-optic cards, redundancy switches, power supply units, and communication cards controlled by the PL700 Manager. It enables centralized supervision of the system by exposing both status and configuration parameters reported by the hardware.

In addition to providing device control, the connector collects environmental and operational metrics, allowing operators to monitor overall system health and quickly identify fault conditions.
