# Harmonic System Manager

This connector receives SNMP traps from the Harmonic Spectrum's System Manager for analysis and monitoring.

The System Manager acts as the administrative hub of a Spectrum media server installation. Its browser-based user interface allows users to make rapid adjustments to system configuration, integrate additional components, and identify fault conditions. The System Manager's fault reporting and alerting capabilities can head off issues before they become critical. It provides both facility-wide control, as well as active monitoring and alerting.
