## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to Use

The **General** page displays the full topology of the OneWeb system: all the **Ground Stations** and the **Satellite Access Points** are displayed in tables. The topology is automatically updated every hour. You can also refresh it manually with the **Retrieve Topology** button.

To retrieve the topology, the connector detects all the views under a root view. You can set the name of that root view using the parameter **Root View**. By default, the value of that parameter is set to *Sites*.

Every view under the root view corresponds to a ground station. The latitude and longitude of the ground station are extracted from the view properties **yPos** and **xPos**. Every view under a ground station view corresponds to a satellite access point.
