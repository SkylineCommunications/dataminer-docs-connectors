## How to use

The credentials of the device must be filled in on the Login page (General \> Login).

Some important parameters are available on the General page:

- **Controller Name**: This parameter shows the name of the **Astro Virtual Controller** element that manages this device. If no such element is used, the parameter will show the exception value *No Virtual Controller Found*.

- **Communication Type**:

  - *Direct Communication*: The element sends the requests directly to the Astro module device.
  - *U100C Proxy*: The element sends the requests to the Astro U100 Controller, which will forward them to the Astro module. The controller acts as a proxy.

- **Communication Method**:

  - *Login*: The element logs in to the device for every request (read and write requests).
  - *Anonymous*: The element only logs in to the device for write requests. The device does not log in for read requests.

To most tables a row/new entry can be added by right-clicking the table and selecting **Add New Entry**. This action will display a pop-up window with the required parameters to add a new entry.

Downloaded files can be found under *C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\\protocol name"\\element name"\\file name"*.
To upload a file, the file must be located in the following folder: *C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\\protocol name"\\element name"\\file name"*. The connector will display a list of available files in that location to upload.
