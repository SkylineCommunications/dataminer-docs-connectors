## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: 161

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Initialization

If you want to use the traps in DataMiner, you will have to enable this on the device and fill in the IP of the DataMiner server.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The connector will work immediately after startup.

You can change the settings for the trap table to clean up so that the table cannot become too large.
