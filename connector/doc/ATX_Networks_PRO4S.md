## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The connector allows you to configure several parameters of the device, such as:

- **Network** properties: NMS site, DNS, and interfaces.
- **Tuner** parameters: Frequency, Symbol Rate, Modulation Mode, and LNB Power.
- **Peripherals** parameters: OPTO settings such as title and commands. Audio, storage, and PAD data is also available for monitoring.

A dedicated **Faults** page is available, which describes the current faults and the number of past faults.
