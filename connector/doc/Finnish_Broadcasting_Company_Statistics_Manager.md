## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to use

The **General** page displays all statistics that are retrieved by this connector. These statistics can be visualized in a dashboard for monitoring purposes.

There are two different kinds of statistics:

- Real-time statistics: updated every hour
- Daily statistics: updated once per day

On the **Configuration** page, you can configure the interval at which the different statistics are refreshed.

This allows statistics that take a longer time to load to be updated more slowly than statistics that can be refreshed quickly. The default update interval is 60 minutes.
