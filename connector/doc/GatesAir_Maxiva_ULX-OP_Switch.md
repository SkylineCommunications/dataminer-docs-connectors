# GatesAir Maxiva ULX-OP Switch

The GateSwitch N+1 provides automated switchover operations between multiple transmitters, transposers or gap fillers/repeaters to ensure transmission continuity even in the event of the failure of one of the units. This equipment stores the operating configurations of the N units in the system and automatically performs the necessary operations to substitute a failed unit with a "+1" spare unit connected to the system.
