## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to use

The element created with this connector consists of only one page, the **General** page. On this page, the **Web Interface URL** must be specified.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The **1.0.0.x** connector range of the Generic Dual Input Virtual Device protocol supports the usage of DCF and can only be used on a DMA with **8.5.4** as the minimum version.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).
