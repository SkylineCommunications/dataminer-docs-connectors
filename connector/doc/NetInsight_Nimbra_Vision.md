# NetInsight Nimbra Vision

## About

The NetInsight Nimbra Vision DataMiner connector is designed to provide management and orchestration functionalities for Nimbra MSR networks. This allows DataMiner to act as an orchestrator of orchestrators, leveraging Vision's computational and routing algorithms while maintaining a comprehensive view of the infrastructure.

## Key Features

The DataMiner Nimbra Vision connector provides not only a comprehensive view of all active Nimbra MSR circuits (with easy filtering based on type, node and metadata), but it also a simplifies the process of setting up a new ad hoc Nimbra MSR circuit. Users can simply choose a service type and a source and destination node, and then click connect. The system automatically computes and schedules the network paths in the background.

- **Schedule services**: Prepare and schedule a circuit for the future with auto-route path detection.
- **Monitoring**: Quick access to specific nodes to promptly assess their health, usage, and alarms.
