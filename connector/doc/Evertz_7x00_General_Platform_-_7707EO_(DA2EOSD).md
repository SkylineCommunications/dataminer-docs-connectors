# Evertz 7x00 General Platform - 7707EO (DA2EOSD)

## About

This connector is used to monitor an Evertz 7707EO card, an electrical-to-optical converter.

This connector is automatically generated by connector [Evertz 7x00 General Platform](xref:Connector_help_Evertz_7x00_General_Platform).

This card returns DA2EOSD as product name. VistaLink (Evertz NMS) uses a config packet name FIBEREO.

## Configuration

The element using this connector is automatically exported from the Evertz 7x00 General Platform connector. The configuration of the element must be done in this parent connector.

Its default name will be DA2EOSD.x, where x is the slot where the card is attached.

## How to Use

The DVE consists of the following data pages:

- **General**: Mainly displays the **Video** parameters.
- **Alarms**: Lists the status of all possible alarms. For each alarm, the **Send Trap** parameter allows you to enable/disable traps for that fault.
