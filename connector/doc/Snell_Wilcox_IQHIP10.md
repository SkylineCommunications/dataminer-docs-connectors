## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### Serial \[Main\] connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device (e.g. *192.168.14.15*).
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device (e.g. *2050*).
  - **Bus address**: Used to fill in the Unit Address and the Unit Port (e.g. 10*.04* is for Unit Address *0x10* and Unit Port *0x04*).

## Usage
