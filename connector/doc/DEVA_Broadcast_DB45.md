## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

### Channel Measurements

This connector can be used to measure the **signals** for **multiple frequencies**. This can be configured in the **Channel Measurements** table.

Depending on the configured **Round Robin Interval**, every x seconds, the signals for a frequency in the Channel Measurements table will be retrieved. When a time interval has elapsed, the next frequency will be set and polled during a next interval.

To add a new frequency that should be measured, simply click the **Add Channel** button and configure the **frequency** in the table. Once everything is configured, you can **enable** this channel to add it to the round-robin loop.
In case you want to make sure it is **polled immediately**, use the **Force** button to immediately start polling the signals for that frequency.
