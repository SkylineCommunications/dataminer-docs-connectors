## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

#### HTTP Main Connection\[2.0.0.x\]

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *80*).
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

For the element to function properly, the current router configuration must be retrieved from the Toolbox 5. To do so, go to **File** \> **Export** and click **Export AudioIDs/LogicsIDs**. This will open a new page, where you should select the file **Ext. DHD AudioID/LogicID Export (.\*dpx)**.

The element must then be configured with this configuration in DataMiner. To do so, on the **General** page, specify the **Path** where the configuration file is stored. Then click the **Load Configuration** button to make the connector parse the configuration file and start retrieving the routing information.

## How to use

On the **Matrix** page of the element, you can route the audio. This can also be done on the **Audio** **I/O** page, using the **Output Audio** table.

In **range 2.0.0.x** of the connector, the pages have been organized to be as similar as possible to the device web interface.
