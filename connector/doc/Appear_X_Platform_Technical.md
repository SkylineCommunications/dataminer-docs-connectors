# Appear X Platform

## About

The Appear X Platform connector allows users to configure and display information from the Appear X10/X20 chassis and its associated module cards.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This connector is the successor of the **[AppearTV X20 platform](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/7bb327a7-0844-4c2b-b5bc-fbfd4e3bc8de)** connector, which will be gradually phased out and will eventually become deprecated. For new greenfield deployments, we strongly recommend using this **Appear X platform** connector instead.

On the U.S. market, the same chassis is also offered under the Sencore brand, with the following model names: **Sencore DMG-3200** (X10 chassis), **Sencore DMG-4100**, and **Sencore DMG-4200** (X20 chassis).

The connector establishes an **HTTP connection**, utilizing the MMI, IpGateway, XGER, ASI, SDI APIs, and Prometheus endpoints to retrieve and configure device data. Information is exchanged in JSON format.

The connector operates sequentially, requesting data from the device, processing responses, and displaying the results. Users can send configuration requests and receive updated information in real-time.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *443*).
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

#### API Login Credentials

When you have created an element with this connector , navigate to the **General** > **Authentication** data page of the element, and specify the API account (username and password) that the element needs to use to gain authenticated API access.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only after a successful API login, will the element be able to establish proper communication with the Appear X platform API.

#### Configurable API Versions

It is possible to configure a specific API version for each card type. To do so, go to the **General** > **Module Config** page.

Increasing the API version will result in extra data being filled in if that API version is supported on the chassis.

### Redundancy

When the Appear Chassis is configured with 2 MMI boards, the device is able to present the APIs DataMiner is consuming on IP interfaces of both MMI boards. This will allow DataMiner to implement API-level redundancy. It will automatically switch over to the secondary IP interface if it detects that the first one becomes unavailable or unresponsive.

To set up this API-level redundancy, go to the **General** > **Redundancy** page of an active Appear X platform element

### Configurable API Polling

To tailor the API requests issued by DataMiner towards the Appear X platform API, go to the data page **General** \> **Poll Manager**. You can enable or disable specific API endpoints as well as set a different polling frequency.

### DCF Connections

#### External Connections

<!-- ### Automation

It is possible to interface with this connector and all available cards by using the available **Appear-X-ConnectorApi**.

> [!NOTE]
> To make use of the Inter Application Framework (InterApp) from any Automation script, install the Appear X application, which can be downloaded from the DataMiner Catalog. -->

## How to use

### General

This page displays the **Chassis Cards Table**, which contains one row per card in the chassis, detailing **Serial**, **Name**, **Hardware**, **Software**, **Slot**, **Features**, **Licenses**, and **State** information.

The following page buttons are available:

- **Authentication**: Displays the current authentication status and allows you to specify a **Username** and **Password** to connect to the device.
- **Redundancy**: The chassis can have two management boards with two separate IP addresses to communicate with. On this subpage, you can specify the redundant IP address and port to be polled for the second gateway in case the first IP gateway goes into timeout. If a redundant IP is configured, the connector will try and switch to this address if a timeout occurs.
- **Module Config**: On this subpage, you can select the implemented API version per card. Increasing the API version for a card will result in extra data being retrieved from the device. For compatibility reasons, the lower API version can be selected to ensure a functional connector in case you are not running a higher API version yet.

### Alarms

This page displays two tables, the **Active Alarms Table** and **Alarms History Table**. These contain information regarding the alarm **Name**, **Severity**, **Time Set** and, for cleared alarms in the history table, **Time Clear**.

### Web Interface
