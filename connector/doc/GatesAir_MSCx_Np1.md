# GatesAir MSCx Np1

## About

The GatesAir Multi-System Controller (MSCx) manages redundancy in radio and television transmitter systems, offering seamless failover control between main and backup transmitters in N+1 or dual configurations.

## Key Features

- **Redundancy mode tracking**: Displays the current redundancy setup (e.g. N+1, 1+1), including transmitter assignments and switch positions.
- **Trap processing**: Receives and processes SNMP traps related to power supply faults, enabling timely alarm propagation in DataMiner.

## Use Case

**Challenge**: Operations teams need centralized visibility of transmitter status, alarms, and operational data across the network.

**Solution**: The connector collects real-time SNMP data from MSCx, including transmitter states, fault conditions, and performance metrics, and displays them in DataMiner.

**Benefit**: Enables unified network management, faster fault detection, and reduced operational overhead.
