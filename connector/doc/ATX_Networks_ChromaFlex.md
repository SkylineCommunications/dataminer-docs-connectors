# ATX Networks ChromaFlex

ATX's ChromaFlex platform and its application-specific modules have been designed for headend and major hub site applications where performance, versatility, and space efficiency are of the highest importance.

The ChromaFlex platform is a mid-plane design with blind mate connectors, 2RU passive chassis with support for redundant power supplies, 8 application-specific modules, and remote monitoring and control of all important operating parameters.

The application modules include the high-performance Chromadigm DWDM transmitter, 1310 nm and DWDM directly modulated transmitters, optical amplifiers, return path receivers, optical destackers, and optical and RF switches.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **IP port**: The IP port of the device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *private.*

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## Usage

### General

This page contains system information parameters, such as the **Software Version**, **Hardware Version**, **Model Name**, **Serial Number**, and **Module Temperature**.

### Modules

This page contains the **Modules Table**. This table displays all the modules of the device.

### DMTx

This page contains 2 tables: **DMTx Modules Table** and **DMTx Lasers Table**.

For each module in the DMTx Modules Table, the **Slot State** indicates the status of the DVE, and the **Remove Module** button allows you to delete the DVE.

With the **DMTx Auto Remove** parameter, you can enable or disable the automatic removal of **unequipped** DVE modules.

Laser entries that are no longer available for the duration of the **DMTx Lasers Expiration Time** will be removed from the table. In case you want the table entries to stay present for a longer period of time, set this parameter to a different value than the default value of 0.

### QRRX

This page contains 2 tables: **QRRX Modules Table** and **QRRX Lasers Table**.

For each module in QRRX Modules Table, the **Slot State** indicates the status of the DVE, and the **Remove Module** button allows you to delete the DVE.

With the **QRRX Auto Remove** parameter, you can enable or disable the automatic removal of **unequipped** DVE modules.

Laser entries that are no longer available for the duration of the **QRRX Lasers Expiration Time** will be removed from the table. In case you want the table entries to stay present for a longer period of time, set this parameter to a different value than the default value of 0.
