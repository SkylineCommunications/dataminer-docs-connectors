# Evertz 7x00 General Platform

The **Evertz 7x00 General Platform** connector is used to monitor and control an Evertz chassis containing different Evertz 7700/7800 series cards.

## About

The chassis must include an **Evertz 7700-FC, Evertz 7800-FC, or Evertz 7801-FC** card in order to be functional. Data about the location of other cards is polled from this card. The Evertz 7700-FC/7800-FC/7801-FC is placed in slot 1; other cards are inserted into slots 2 to 15. A DVE will be created for each (supported) card. Data is polled via **SNMP**. Traps are supported to reduce the amount of polling. When a trap is received, the corresponding parameter is polled again to update its value.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP main connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP Connection:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13*.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device. The default value is *private*.

## Usage

This connector displays information about the Frame Controller (**Evertz 7700-FC/Evertz 7800-FC**) and the inserted cards.

### Input Cards

This page lists all the modules embedded in the chassis and their corresponding slots. If cards have been changed, press the **Refresh Cards** button to see the changes immediately. If you activate the **Automatically Delete Offline Rows** toggle button, cards that get removed from the frame will not be moved to the Input Cards \[DEL\] page.

### Traps Logging

The connector can log traps directly into the database for all cards that have the **Log Traps** column set to enabled in the **Input Cards** table. These rows will **expire after one year**.

### General

This page displays general parameters for the **Evertz 7700-FC/Evertz 7800-FC** controller, such as the **Temperature**, **Power Supply**, etc.

### SNMP Config

On this page, you can configure the **SNMP** agent: the **trap** destination, the communities, etc.

### License (range 1.0.2.x only)

This page displays information and settings related to the licensing for the different supported cards.

In the **Card License Table**, the main parameters influencing the license status of a card are displayed:

- **Card Name:** The names of the supported cards.
- **Status:** The status of the license for each specific card (*Unknown* (default), *Installed* or *Not Installed*).
- **Polling State:** The polling state of each card (*Enabled* (default) or *Disabled*).

The **Card License Table** is provisioned based on data stored in a **CSV file** in the following location: *C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\DMA_COMMON_DOCUMENTS\Protocols\Evertz 7x00 General Platform\License\ProductLicenseStatus.csv*.

This file contains the following headers:

- **Product Name**: The name of the card.
- **License Status**: Either *Installed* or *Not Installed*.

Below the header, the data for the targeted cards should be entered.

If this file is not found or if information regarding a specific card is not present, the default values will be applied to the parameters in the table.

The **License** page also contains the **Enforce License Check button**, which enables/disables the enforcement of license checks throughout the connector:

- **Disabled:** All card types will be polled.
- **Enabled:** Only card types of which the Status is *Installed* or *Unknown* and the Polling State is *Enabled* will be polled.

Finally, the **Refresh button** can be used to update the contents of the Card License Table with the contents from the source file.
