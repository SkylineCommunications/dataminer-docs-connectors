## How to use

The Sencore OmniHub has a limited SNMP feature set. Parameters are limited to status and configuration parameters defined in a limited MIB, and SNMP traps are not supported at this time.

Each page contains information related to the OmniHub device such as the IP inputs and outputs, which can be configured in the associated **Settings** table.
