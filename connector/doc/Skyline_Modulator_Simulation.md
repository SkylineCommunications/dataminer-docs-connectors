# Skyline Modulator Simulation

## About

The Skyline Modulator Simulation driver is designed to emulate the behavior of a modulator for demonstration and testing purposes. It provides a virtual environment where modulator parameters can be monitored and controlled, enabling users to simulate operational scenarios without requiring a physical device. 

This makes it suitable for training, proof-of-concept setups, and system demonstrations.

## Key Features

### Demo and Training Support

Suitable  for showcasing system capabilities or training personnel without the need for actual hardware.

### Safe Testing Environment

Allows safe experimentation with parameter changes and system workflows without risking real equipment.
