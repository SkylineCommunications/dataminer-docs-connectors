# Rohde Schwarz ETX-T

## About

The **Rohde Schwarz ETX-T** is a cost-effective monitoring receiver in compliance with the DVB-T standard. It is designed to help broadcasters to maintain the quality level of their networks. It performs real-time monitoring of the most sensitive parameters of digital transmitters such as output level, MER, or BER. Optionally, the demodulated MPEG2 transport stream is analyzed to check the syntax integrity (first-, second-, and third-priority errors as defined in ETSI TR 101 290) as well as to monitor data rates and MIP consistency in single frequency networks.

### Key Features

- **Real-time monitoring**: Monitor MPEG-2 transport streams, with focus on key metrics for quick insights and diagnostics.
- **Integrity Check**: View all priority errors of the analyzed transport stream in one overview.

## Use Cases

### Priority errors

**Challenge**: The quality level of a network over which a TS is sent must be checked.

**Solution**: The **Rohde Schwarz ETX-T** connector allows users to monitor this quality level easily.
