# Evertz 7x00 General Platform Group 2 - 7881DEC2MP2HD

The 7881DEC2MP2HD card is a high-quality SD/HD MPEG2 decoder card. It is typically used for monitoring applications or decoding for downstream baseband video and audio processing. It can reconstruct all VANC and HANC data in the HD/SDI output and can be coupled with an Evertz RF front end (7780DM2-LB DVB-S2 demodulator) and Evertz downstream video and audio processing equipment to create a complete versatile integrated receiver/decoder.

An **SNMP** connection is used to retrieve and configure the information of the card. There are also different possibilities available for **alarm monitoring** and **trending**.

This connector is automatically generated by the parent connector [Evertz 7x00 General Platform Group 2](xref:Connector_help_Evertz_7x00_General_Platform_Group_2).
