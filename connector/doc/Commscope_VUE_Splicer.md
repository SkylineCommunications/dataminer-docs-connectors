- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The **General** page shows **System Info** parameters like **Name**, **Description**, **Model**, and **Uptime**. It also has information for the **Nodes** and **Interfaces**.

The **Alarms** page shows the Active **Alarms** as well as the Active **Alarm Variables**, which gives extra information. It has a subpage with the **Alarm Definition** table where the **Severity** and **Description** of the alarm are fetched from.
