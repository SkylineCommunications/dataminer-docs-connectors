# RFS MSV Monitoring System

## About

The RFS MSV Monitoring System connector enables data integration and monitoring of RFS Multi-Sector Vector (MSV) RF distribution systems. This connector retrieves operational and performance data from the MSV platform, including parameters such as forward and reflected power, VSWR/return loss, and device status combiners and RF paths. The connector uses SNMP to communicate with the device.

## Key Features

- **Real-time monitoring**: Allows you to monitor the MSV system in real time, with alarm and trending capabilities.

## Use Case

**Challenge**: Operators need to monitor multiple RFS MSV Monitoring Systems across many sites to quickly identify and resolve RF issues that could impact service coverage and quality.

**Solution**: Use the RFS MSV Monitoring System connector to integrate these systems into DataMiner, enabling centralized monitoring and correlation of RF performance data with other network elements.

**Benefit**: Monitoring the RFS MSV Monitoring System through DataMiner allows operators to detect and address issues prior to customer impact, improving overall network reliability and service quality.
