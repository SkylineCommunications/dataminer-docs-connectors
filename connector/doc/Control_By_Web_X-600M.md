# Control By Web X-600M

The **Control By Web X-600M** is a multifunction web-enabled industrial I/O controller. It performs control, logic, and monitoring functions for other ControlByWeb modules and allows users to design custom web-based applications.

## Key Features

- **Modular I/O expansion**: Supports a wide range of I/O modules for flexible system configuration.
- **Web-based interface**: Built-in web server for remote monitoring and control without additional software.
- **Advanced logic & scripting**: Create custom logic using an intuitive interface with scripting capabilities.
- **Data logging & alerts**: Logs data and sends notifications via email, SMS, or SNMP traps.
- **Secure access**: HTTPS encryption and user authentication for secure remote access.

## Use Cases

### Remote Industrial Monitoring

**Challenge**: Industrial sites require continuous monitoring of environmental parameters and equipment status across multiple locations.

**Solution**: The X-600M allows remote access to sensor data and system status via its web interface, eliminating the need for on-site personnel.

**Benefit**: Reduces operational costs, improves response time to system failures, and ensures compliance with industry regulations.

### Automated Equipment Control

**Challenge**: Industrial facilities need an automated way to control pumps, valves, and other machinery based on real-time sensor data.

**Solution**: Using built-in logic and scripting, the X-600M automates equipment operations based on predefined conditions.

**Benefit**: Enhances efficiency, reduces manual intervention, and minimizes the risk of human error.
