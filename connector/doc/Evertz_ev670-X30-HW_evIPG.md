# Evertz ev670-X30-HW evIPG

This connector is used to monitor the Evertz ev670-X30-HW evIPG device.

The 670 is a virtualized media processing platform that enables users to move a broadcast services infrastructure to a generic hardware platform when required. It is an FPGA-accelerated compute blade that supports both 12G/3G/HD-SDI and IP interfaces. Its gateway capabilities for IP include encapsulation/de-encapsulation of SDI over 25 GbE, as well as protocol conversion including SMPTE ST 2022-6 and SMPTE ST 2110. It allows direct conversion of up to 16x input and 16x output SD/HD/3G signals to/from IP using SMPTE ST 2022-6 or ST 2110 formats, and it also provides per-input AVM monitoring, time-stamped Ethernet outputs, and audio/video synchronization. It also features multi-path, multi-flow packet merging for bit error resilience in networks. The 670 can be managed via the integrated HTTP web interface, in-band via its 25 GbE interface, and using SNMP via frame controller.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The element created with this connector has several data pages:

- The **General** page displays the uptime, ID, name, and location of the system.
- The **System** page displays information about the port configuration and contains several subpages with information about the different system configuration options.
- On the **Route Control**, **SDI Input**, and **SDI Output** pages, you can find numerous tables with information related to these topics.
- On the **IP Input** and **IP** **Output** pages, you can find several tables with information about the audio, video, and ancillary channels.
- On the **Product Location, Hardware, Hardware LED, Software, Proxy Configuration**, and **Time Management** pages, you can find various tables with information and settings related to these subjects.
- The **SNMP Traps, Video Notify, Audio Notify**, and **Notify** pages display tables where you can add/remove traps destinations as well as read/change the state and value of traps.

## Notes 1.0.3.2 Version

You can enable/disable polling-specific QSFPs from the **QSFP Monitor** page. This will affect all tables related to that QSFP.
