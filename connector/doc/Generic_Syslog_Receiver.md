# Generic Syslog Receiver

The Generic Syslog Receiver is used to capture and analyze information received via Syslog messages.

Elements using this protocol are **constantly listening** to incoming Syslog messages that are sent from **one or more network devices**. The connector processes these messages and displays the messages in an overview along with the severity. Filtering the incoming messages is possible based on severity or based on specific data in the message. The connector can also be used to trigger specific alarms and to write the messages to log files.

The communication method used is **smart-serial**.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The IP should be set to the specific keyword *any*. This will make sure the Syslog Receiver takes the Server role.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device, by default *514*.

## Usage

### General

This is the default page of the connector. It contains the **Message Table**, which displays all the information of the incoming syslog messages. There are also page buttons to specific subpages for **Priority**, **Layout**, and **Raw Messages**.

### Alarms

This page contains the **Alarm Configuration** table. In this table, you can create specific alarms configurations based on the incoming messages.

It also contains the **Alarms Table**, which displays an overview of all the generated alarms.

### Log Messages

This page contains a toggle button that can be used to enable or disable the storing of syslog messages in log files. You can also specify the folder where those files will be stored.

### Alert Counter

This page contains the **Alert Counter Table**, which allows you to track the number of incoming syslog messages that match specific search criteria.
