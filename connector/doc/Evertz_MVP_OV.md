# Evertz MVP OV

The MVP is a multi-image display and monitoring system. It provides a highly flexible, intuitive and comprehensive approach to virtual wall monitor applications. With the MVP, any input signal can be displayed on any output monitor without the need for DAs or upstream monitor routers.

## About

This connector is intended to work with the **Evertz MVP OV** card. It was designed to provide status monitoring and fault trigger parameters.

### Version Info

| Range | Description | DCF Integration | Cassandra Compliant |
|--|--|--|--|
| 1.0.0.x | SNMP set not working. | No | Yes |
| 2.0.0.x [SLC Main] | Now uses DVEs for each bus address instead of using the bus address to look at a single channel. | No | Yes |

## Installation and Configuration

### Creation

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161.*
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
