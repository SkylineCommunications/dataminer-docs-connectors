## Installation and configuration

## Creation

#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## Usage

### General

This page displays the **Alarm Table** and the **Alarm State** (without the timeout state) together with the **Overall Alarm State** (with the timeout state).

The **DCF Interfaces** toggle button, which is disabled by default, can be enabled to allow access to the Interfaces page.

### Interfaces

This page displays the **Interfaces Table**. Via the context menu of this table, you can add inputs and outputs.

### Settings

This page displays the **Settings Table** and the **Selected Type**.

With the **Quick Type Table Set** parameter, you can populate the table with a single set.

## Notes

When the number of rows in the **Alarm table** is determined via **Selected Type**, the element connections can be configured under **Element Connections**.

For every key in the table, an element can be selected; as parameter, choose **\[Element Alarm State\]**.
