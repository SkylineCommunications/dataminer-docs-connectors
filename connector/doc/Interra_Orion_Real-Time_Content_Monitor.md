# Interra Orion Real-Time Content Monitor

## About

This connector integrates DataMiner with Interra Systems' ORION platform, a real-time content monitoring system for IP-based video delivery. ORION tracks stream quality metrics including Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Experience (QoE), closed caption compliance, audio loudness (CALM/EBU), and ad insertion verification. Through this connector, users can retrieve and visualize ORION monitoring data directly in DataMiner, enabling centralized visibility across distributed video delivery infrastructures.

## Key Features

**Feed Monitoring**: Displays all available video feeds monitored by ORION, including their current health status.

**PID Inspection**: Retrieves and presents Program Identifiers (PIDs) for each feed, supporting in-depth stream analysis.

**Service Monitoring**: Offers a complete view of monitored services and their compliance or error states.
