## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *443*).
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

After element creation, specify a valid **User Name** and **Password** to start polling data from the device. To do so, in version 1.0.0.x, go to the **Security Settings** subpage of the **General** page. In version 2.0.0.x, these settings are available directly on the **General** page.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use - 1.0.0.x

### General Page

This page mainly displays **system information**. This includes information about the **Device Name**, **Vendor**, **Version** and **Image ID**.

Via the **Security Settings** page button, you can define the **Username** and **Password** to connect to the device.

### Ethernet

This page displays a table with information related to the Ethernet port.

### TX Interfaces

This page displays the tables relates to the TX interfaces, i.e. **TX Interfaces VLANS** and **TX Interfaces Host**.

This page has a subpage called **Statistics**, which contains information related to **TX Interface Statistics**, including **TX Session**, **TX PDV Statistics**, **TX Session Payload** and **TX Session Monitored PIDs**.

### RX Interfaces

This page displays the tables related to the RX interfaces, i.e. **RX Interfaces VLANS** and **RX Interfaces Host**.

This page has a subpage called **Statistics**, which contains information related to **RX Interface Statistics**, including **RX Session**, **RX PDV Statistics**, **RX Session Payload** and **RX Session Monitored PIDs**.

### TX Policy

This page displays details about the TX policy.

This page has a subpage called **Payload**, which contains TX payload information, including **TX Payload SDI, TX Policy Payload TS** and **TX Policy Monitored PIDs**.

### RX Policy

This page displays details about the RX policy.

This page has a subpage called **Payload**, which contains RX payload information, including **RX Payload SDI, RX Policy Payload TS** and **RX Policy Monitored PIDs**.

## How to use - 2.0.1.x / 2.0.2.x

### General Page

This page mainly displays **system information**. This includes information about the **Device Name**, **Vendor**, **Version** and **Image ID**.

On this page, you can also define the **Username** and **Password** to connect to the device. This must be done in order to be able to retrieve any data with the connector.

Pressing the **Login** button will force a refresh of the element's data.

### Manage Devices

This page allows you to **create new devices** (new rules) in the system.

To create a device, you should always specify the following information: the sender and receiver **Source IP Address**, **Source Port**, **Destination IP Address** and **Destination Port**, a **Network Port**, and the definition of the **Encapsulation** and **Bit Rate**. Other data is optional.

On the **RTP Alarming**, **Payload Alarming** and **Protect** tab pages, additional configuration options are available.

NOTE: To interact with the tables, use the table context menus. Also note that it is currently not possible to configure both merging and mirroring, as both features require the use of the backplane ports.

### Devices

This page contains device information for both **senders and receivers** of the devices, including the devices' IPs, ports, and generic network configuration. A device can be deleted from the device table.

A page button provides access to the **Alarm Configuration** subpage, where the alarm configuration for each device is displayed. Depending on the selected encapsulation, the information for each device can be shown in different tables.

On the **Device Resources** page, you can map a device to a resource.

### Ports

This page contains the network information for the hardware ports/interfaces of the device, separated into receivers and senders. Typically, the device contains four ports: two on the frontplane and two on the backplane. However, there is hardware support for two extra backplane ports. The information available on this page is all network-related. It includes **Packet** information, **Bit Rates** and **Bytes**.

### Interfaces

This page displays **Ethernet statistics** for device **senders and receivers**. This includes **ARP**, **ICMP** and **IGMP statistics**.

### Encapsulation

This page contains statistical information for SMPTE-2022-2 and SMPTE-2022-6 encapsulation. The focus for SMPTE-2022-2 is on **Program** tables and **PIDs**; for SMPTE-2022-6 it is on **video** and **audio** statistics.

### RTP

This page contains **RTP statistics** for both **senders and receivers**, including **packets**, **uptime**, **bit rates** and **status and error** information.

### PDV

This page displays the **Packet Data Variation** statistics for both **senders and receivers**. Average values are shown for several time spans.

### FEC

This page displays the **Forward Error Correction** statistics for both **senders and receivers**, including the **FEC mode** and the **dropped** and **recovered** packets.
