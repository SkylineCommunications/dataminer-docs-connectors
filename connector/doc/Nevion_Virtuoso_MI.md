# Nevion Virtuoso MI

## About

This is a DataMiner connector for the Nevion Virtuoso MI, a media server designed for broadcast carrier-class applications. The connector uses an HTTP connection to allow monitoring of the Nevion Virtuoso MI.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive monitoring pages**: Centralized visibility across device info, IP interfaces, Ethernet, ASI/IP input/output, transport streams, services, and alarms.
- **Configurable inputs and flows**: Control interface states, ASI labels/enable flags, TS modes, IP input flow selection (Auto/A/B), and buffer/FEC settings directly from the UI.

## Use Cases

### Network Interface Control

- **Challenge**: Need to enable/disable and tune network interfaces quickly.
- **Solution**: Configure detailed settings using this connector, including IP interfaces and Ethernet states, routing, sync input, SIPS A/B flow, FEC, and buffer regulator.
- **Benefit**: Optimized network behavior and reduced packet loss.
