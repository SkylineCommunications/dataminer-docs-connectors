## About

This is a DataMiner connector for the Nevion Virtuoso MI, a media server designed for broadcast carrier-class applications. The connector uses an HTTP connection to allow monitoring of the Nevion Virtuoso MI.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Monitoring Pages**: Centralized visibility across device info, IP interfaces, Ethernet, ASI/IP input/output, transport streams, services, and alarms.
- **Configurable Inputs and Flows**: Control interface states, ASI labels/enable flags, TS modes, IP input flow selection (Auto/A/B), and buffer/FEC settings directly from the UI.

## Use Cases

### Network Interface Control

**Challenge**: Need to enable/disable and tune network interfaces quickly.  
**Solution**: Configure `IP Interfaces` and `Ethernet` states, routing, and sync input; adjust SIPS `Flow A/B`, FEC, and buffer regulator.  
**Benefit**: Optimized network behavior and reduced packet loss.
