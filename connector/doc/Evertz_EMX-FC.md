## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The element created with this connector consists of the following data pages:

- **General**: Provides device information, including the **Device Description**, **Device Up Time**, **Device Contact**, **Device Name**, and **Device Location**.
- **Faults**: Contains the **Faults Table**. The **Name** column of the table lists the index combined with the monitored device, the **Fault** column contains the alarm value, **Status** shows if the alarm is *Enabled* or *Disabled*, and the **Send Trap** column can be used to enable or disable the trap functionality on the device.
