## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. By default, this is not used.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

On the **General** page, you can find basic configuration parameters like system time, system version, etc.

The page also includes the very important **Configuration** parameter, which allows you to start or stop the transmission. You can also reboot the content server, and more.

You also can verify the **status** of every existing module, including timestamps, results and messages.

On the **Broadcast Activation** page, you can configure the **Broadcast Configuration ID.** Note that at the moment only sets are possible for this specific parameter.
