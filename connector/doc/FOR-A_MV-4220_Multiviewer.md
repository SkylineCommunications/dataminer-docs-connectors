## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

#### Serial IP Connection - LAN Commands Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination. The IP port is **always 51000 + the last octet of the IP address** (e.g. if the IP address is *192.168.0.112*, the IP port is *51112*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

This connector will poll the **Unit Info**, **Unit Status**, **Output Status** and **Video Window Status**.

Device alarms can be reset via the **Reset Alarm** button on the Video Window Status page.

Output presets can be configured on the Screen Select page.

You can find the received traps in the Traps table on the Traps page. When a specific trap is received, the corresponding parameter(s) will be polled again to make sure the latest data is displayed.
