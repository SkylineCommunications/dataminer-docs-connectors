# Broadcast Tools Site Sentinel

## About

The Site SentinelÂ® 16 G2 is a robust, full-featured, web-enabled sixteen-channel remote control featuring a desktop/mobile browser-compatible web interface (HTML5.) The system is equipped with 16 metering inputs (0 to 10 VDC), four virtual metering channels, 16 optically isolated status (logic) inputs, 33 programmable SPDT relays, which may be configured for ON, OFF, and pulsed operation, four temperature probe inputs, one internal temperature sensor, stereo silence sensor, and power failure input. It also includes built-in support for email alarms and SNMP.

## Key Features

- Monitor and generate DataMiner alarms for the status of relays to **improve uptime** and reduce downtime of critical equipment.
- **Remotely configure and control each relay** from your DataMiner System to improve operational efficiency.
- Frequent polling and trap retrieval for updating meter values to ensure optimal **alarm monitoring of fluctuating and out-of-spec equipment readings**.
- Chassis temperature and temperature probe monitoring.

## Use Cases

- From a single pane of glass, aggregate meter values and relay statuses from multiple sites to control and monitor critical equipment located at broadcast facilities, remote sites, data centers, etc. from your DataMiner System.
- Integrate meter and relay monitoring and control into your existing monitoring workflow via DataMiner Correlation, Automation, Dashboards, Low-Code Apps, and Visual Overview.
- Use the historical data collection mechanisms within DataMiner to automate the generation of scheduled reports based upon the meter and relay status of various equipment.
