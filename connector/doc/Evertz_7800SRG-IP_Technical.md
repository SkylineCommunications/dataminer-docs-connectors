# Evertz 7800SRG-IP

The 7800SRG-IP is a PTP Slave Sync Generator designed to provide precise synchronization for hybrid IP and baseband broadcast environments.

The 7800SRG-IP acts as a reliable timing source by locking to an upstream PTP grandmaster clock over Ethernet and generating six independently configurable sync outputs. It supports various timing signals, including black burst, tri-level sync, continuous wave signals, and word clock, ensuring seamless synchronization across diverse broadcast and production workflows.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

### General Page

You can find all the information related to the device general parameters on this page.

### Sync Page

The Sync table on this page has the following columns:

- **Mode**: Sets the sync output mode (e.g. black burst, tri-level sync, CW signals).
- **VITC Control**: Enables Vertical Interval Timecode (VITC) on PAL or NTSC outputs.
- **VITC Line \<1-2>**: Defines the VITC insertion lines (PAL: 6-31, NTSC: 10-30).
- **Drop Frame Control**: Enables the drop frame bit for NTSC timecode.
- **Color Frame**: Enables color frame reference for PAL or NTSC outputs.
- **Set Jam Time**: Sets the jam time for video output.
- **Jam Output**: Forces the output VITC time to match the reference.
- **Time Offset**: Adjusts the timecode offset in frames for video outputs.
- **Time Zone**: Sets the time zone for video outputs (-12:00 to +12:00 in 30-min steps).
- **DST Control**: Enables automatic Daylight Saving Time (DST) adjustment.
- **Ten Field Control**: Enables a ten-field pulse on NTSC outputs.
- **Color Phase**: Adjusts the color frame phase (PAL: 1-4, NTSC: 1-2).
- **Vertical Phase**: Adjusts the vertical sync phase.
- **Horizontal Phase**: Adjusts the horizontal sync phase.
- **Fine Phase**: Allows fine-tuning of the sync phase as a percentage (0.00% to 99.4%).
- **Word Clock Level**: Selects 5V CMOS or Â±1V sinusoidal output for word clock.
- **Timecode Source**: Defines timecode behavior.

### PTP

In this section, you will find the **PTP Port** and **PTP List** tables, along with **PTP Priority** parameters.

### Fault

Here you can find the **Management Fault** table. You can configure alarm monitoring on this table to be alerted of faults.
