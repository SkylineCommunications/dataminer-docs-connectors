# Generic Database

This is a database connector that is used to make queries on demand. It retrieves data from a query inserted in a box in the element and provides information such as the Query Result String, Query Result Numeric, Query Status, Query Status Config OK, Query Status Config Alarm, Query Execution Time, and Query Execution Status.

## About

### Version Info

| Range | Description | DCF Integration | Cassandra Compliant |
|--|--|--|--|
| 1.0.0.x | Database connection. | No | Yes |
| 2.0.0.x | Database connection supports viewing an array result as a table. | No | Yes |
| 2.0.1.x [SLC Main] | This range supports numeric results for MySQL and ODBC database types. It also adds an option to specify the MySQL SSL Mode and support for adding results of multiple queries to Table Result and Table Result 2 instead of always overriding the last query result. | No | Yes |

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to Use (1.0.0.x range)

### General page

This page displays the **Query Execution Interval**, which allows you to choose the interval between queries. This interval can also be disabled.

You can select the appropriate **Date Time Mode** and specify the **Date Time Format**.

If you want to monitor more than one query at once, you can add multiple queries with the **Add Query** button.

In order to execute a query on demand, you can use the **Force Execution** drop-down box to select which query should be executed. The result will be displayed in the table below.

### Configuration page

To configure the element using this connector, go to the **Configuration** page and select the appropriate **Database Type**. Then fill in the **Server Address**, **Database Name**, **User Name**, and **Password**.

Via the **Test Connection** page button, you can check if the connection has been established. Click the **Connect** button and then check the **Connection Result** field.

## How to Use (2.0.0.x range)

### General page

On this page, a **Query Overview** table is used to create and display queries. With the **Result Configuration** option, you can select how the query result will be parsed. The possible options are *String* and *Array*. After each query result of type String, the tables Table Result and Table Result 2 will be cleared. That means if you first execute a query of type Array, and then execute a query of type String, the data for the query of type Array will be lost.

### Table Result page

This page displays the array result as a table. It supports a maximum of 10 columns in the query result. It supports both string and numeric results. The primary key of this table will be the value from the first column in the query result. If there are duplicate values in the first column of the query result, then only the first row with this value will be displayed. It has a very basic way of converting a string result to numeric, which causes the numeric result to not always be accurate. For example, a date string may be parsed to a numeric value that only contains the day number.

### Table Result 2 page

This page displays the array result as a table where each value in the query result column is a separate row. It supports both string and numeric results. The primary key of this table is a combination of the column name and the value from the first column in the query result. If there are duplicate values in the first column of the query result, only the first row with this value will be displayed. It has the same method of parsing string values to numeric as Table Result.

### Configuration page

To configure the element using this connector, go to the **Configuration** page and select the appropriate **Database Type**. Then fill in the **Server Address**, **Database Name**, **User Name**, and **Password**.

Via the **Test Connection** page button, you can check if the connection has been established. Click the **Connect** button and then check the **Connection Result** field.

It is also possible to specify the **Port** for MySQL database type.

## How to Use (2.0.1.x range)

### General page

On this page, a **Query Overview** table is used to create and display queries. With the **Result Configuration** option, you can select how the query result will be parsed. The possible options are *String*, *Numeric*, and *Array*. Unlike the 2.0.0.x range, after a query result of type String or Numeric, the existing data in the tables Table Result and Table Result 2 will not be cleared.

### Table Result page

This page displays the array result as a table. It supports both string and numeric results. The primary key is a combination of the IDX of the query from the query overview table and the query result row number. It displays a maximum of 10 columns from the query result. If less than 10 columns are used, the value of the unused columns will be set to N/A. At the end of the table, there is a **Raw Result** column that contains a JSON representation of the complete row, including all original columns from the query result. For each column, it will try to parse string values as a number in an improved way compared to the 2.0.0.x range. If it is not possible, N/A will be displayed as the corresponding numeric value.

### Table Result 2 page

This page displays the array result as a table where each value in the query result column is a separate row. It supports both string and numeric results. The primary key is a combination of the IDX of the query from the query overview table, the query result row number, and the column name. For each row, it will try to parse string values as a number using the same method as Table Result. If this is not possible, N/A will be displayed.

### Configuration page

#### Database type

To configure the element using this connector, go to the **Configuration** page and select the appropriate **Database Type**. The different possibilities are *MySQL*, *MSSQL*, *ODBC*, and *Elasticsearch*.

For the **MySQL** database type, specify the **User Name**, **Password**, **Server Address**, and **Database Name**. You can also specify the **Port** and the **MySQL SSL Mode**. The latter can be used to select the SSL mode when connecting with MySQL. The different options are:

- *None*: Do not use SSL.
- *Preferred*: Use SSL if the server supports it. This is the default option.
- *Required*: Always use SSL. Deny the connection if the server does not support SSL. Does not validate CA or hostname.

For the **ODBC** database type, specify the **User Name**, **Password**, and **ODBC Data Source Name**.

For the **MSSQL** database type, specify the **User Name**, **Password**, **Server Address**, and **Database Name**.

For the **Elasticsearch** database type, specify the **Server Name**. Optionally, the **User Name** and **Password** can be filled in if authentication is required. When creating an Elasticsearch query, you need to define the **ES Endpoint URI** in the **Query Overview** table.

#### General configuration

Via the **Test Connection** page button, you can check if the connection has been established. Click the **Connect** button and then check the **Connection Result** field.

Enabling the **Override Table Results** parameter will limit the data in Table Result and Table Result 2 to only one array result for all queries. That means that each time a new array result is retrieved, the old data will be completely removed and only the new array result will be displayed. This is also the default behavior, continued from the 2.0.0.x range. Disabling this parameter will allow Table Result and Table Result 2 to store the array result for all queries at the same time. In this case, when there is a new array result for a query that has no data yet in the Table Result and Table Result 2 tables, the array result will be added to the tables. If there already is data in those tables for that query, the old data will be overridden with the new array result.

The parameters **Table Result Maximum Rows** and **Table Result 2 Maximum Rows** can be used to limit the number of rows that can be added to the tables.
