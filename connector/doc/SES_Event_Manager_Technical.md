# SES Event Manager

## About

The SES Event Manager is a DataMiner connector that automates event and ticket management for SES satellite operations. It polls active alarms from DataMiner elements, processes them as events, and manages the full ticket lifecycle through the DataMiner Ticketing Module (DOM-based).

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection - Main

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

After creating the element, the following configuration steps are required:

1. **Ticket Automation**: Navigate to the **Ticket Automation** page and configure at least one automation rule by specifying an automation name and the corresponding DataMiner Automation script name.

2. **CMDB Systems**: On the **CMDB Systems** page, add the relevant CMDB system mappings for your environment. Only alarms from elements that have a matching CMDB system property configured will be processed by the connector.

3. **Support NOC**: On the **Support NOC** page, add your Support NOC entries and set a default NOC for ticket assignment.

4. **Enable Polling**: On the **General** page, set **Poll Active Alarms** to _Enabled_ to start monitoring alarms.

### General Configurations

The following parameters can be configured on the **General Configurations** page:

- **Event Evaluation Frequency** (1–1800 seconds, default: 30s): How often events are evaluated for ticket creation.
- **Ticket Escalation Time** (10–600 seconds, default: 30s): Time before an event is escalated to a ticket.
- **Ticket Lookup Frequency**: How often the connector checks for ticket status updates.
- **Ticket Follow-up Delay**: Delay for handling events that clear before a ticket is created.
- **Cleanup Method**: Choose between _Max Number_ or _Max Duration_ for resolved event cleanup.

## How to Use

### General Page

The **General** page provides an overview of all managed events. Context menu actions are available on the events table for manual event operations.

### Ticket Automation Page

The **Ticket Automation** page allows you to define rules that map automation names to DataMiner Automation scripts. When a new event is detected, the connector can execute the configured script to handle ticket creation and processing according to your custom logic.

### CMDB Systems Page

The **CMDB Systems** page is used to configure mappings between events and your Configuration Management Database. This enriches events with contextual information such as associated carriers, satellites, and services.

### Support NOC Page

The **Support NOC** page manages your Support Network Operations Center entries. You can add multiple NOC teams and designate one as the default, which will be used for automatic ticket assignment.

### Logs Page

The **Logs** page displays error logs generated by the connector. Automatic cleanup is applied based on the configured retention policy.

### Polling and Timers

The connector uses three internal timers:

- **Timer 1 (10s)**: Evaluates events and performs ticket lookups.
- **Timer 2 (1 min)**: Polls active alarms and processes ticket follow-ups.
- **Timer 3 (1 hour)**: Runs resolved event cleanup and error log cleanup.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a virtual connector. No data traffic will be seen in the Stream Viewer.

## Notes

### Migration to New Ticketing Module

Version 2.0.0.x introduced a migration from the legacy ticketing system to the new DataMiner Ticketing Module built on DOM (Domain Object Model). If upgrading from the 1.0.0.x range, ensure your DataMiner system supports the DOM-based ticketing module before deploying this version.
