# Thomson Video Networks FUZE-1 Playout System

This connector will be use to monitor FUZE-1 Playout System. FUZE-1 Playout is a completely new approach that integrates the traditional playout functions of a channel in a box (CiaB) with premium-quality encoding and transcoding for broadcast and OTT delivery. Ideal for applications such as ad insertion, branding, disaster recovery, and EAS insertion, FUZE-1 provides a rich playout infrastructure together with the ability to process audio and video either directly in the compressed domain or by going back to baseband and re-encoding.
