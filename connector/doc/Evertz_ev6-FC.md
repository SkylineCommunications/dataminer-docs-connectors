# Evertz ev6-FC

The ev6-FR's architecture enables modules with advanced functionality because of their significantly larger size compared to any other multi-frame platform. All modules in the ev 6RU series and legacy 3000 series of Evertz products occupy the full vertical height of the 6RU frame and can be mixed and matched within each frame to build complex signal processing chains.
