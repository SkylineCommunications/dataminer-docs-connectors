- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination. (default: *443*)
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

For the connector to work properly, you need to specify the username and password on the General page.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The element consists of the following data pages:

- **General**: Allows you to specify the username and password to log in. A status parameter indicates whether you are logged in or logged out.
