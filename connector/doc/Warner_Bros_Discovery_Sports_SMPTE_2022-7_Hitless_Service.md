# Warner Bros Discovery Sports SMPTE 2022-7 Hitless Service

The Warner Bros Discovery Sports SMPTE 2022-7 Hitless connector can be applied to any service related to the event system to monitor the seamless source (Hitless) status.

## Key Features

- **Real-time overview**: Monitor the seamless source status of the incoming signals and detect any changes with the enhanced service connector.

## Use Cases

### Monitoring of the SMPTE 2022-7 Seamless Status
