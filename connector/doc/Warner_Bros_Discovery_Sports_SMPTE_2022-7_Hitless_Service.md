# Warner Bros Discovery Sports SMPTE 2022-7 Hitless Service

## About

The Warner Bros Discovery Sports SMPTE 2022-7 Hitless connector can be applied to any service related to the event system to monitor the seamless source (Hitless) status.

## Key Features

**Real-time overview**: Monitor the seamless source status of the incoming signals and detect any changes with the enhanced service connector.

## Use Case: Monitoring of the SMPTE 2022-7 Seamless Status

**Challenge:** The incoming signals need to originate from the same site for the SMPTE 2022-7 Seamless Status to be considered OK. If one of the device is referencing a source from a different site, an alarm should notify operators.

**Solution:** The connector monitors and alarms the source signals and composes a calculated alarm status: Hitless.

**Benefit:** Automatic source monitoring on the event services.

## Technical Info

This enhanced service connector must be applied to an existing service.
