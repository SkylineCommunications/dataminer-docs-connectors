## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *443*).
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

For the connector to be able to poll information from the API, you need to fill in the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** on the **Authentication** page of the element.

As the **Authentication URL** can be changed in the device, this can also be configured on the Authentication page.

## How to use

On the General page, you can see information about the **partitions**. Information regarding **channels**, **pipelines**, **asset locations** and **missing events** is also available.
