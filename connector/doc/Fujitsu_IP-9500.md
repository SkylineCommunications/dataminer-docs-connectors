# Fujitsu IP-9500

The Fujitsu IP-9500 connector has been designed to monitor IP-9500 high-performance encoder/decoder devices. The Fujitsu IP-9500 is an audio/video codec that utilizes advanced MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) encoding to perform real-time transmission of HDTV at low bit rates over DVB and broadband IP networks.

## About

Applying the latest MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) video processing algorithms, IP-9500D can provide best-in-class video fidelity for an application in Electronic News Gathering (ENG) as well as broadcast contribution and distribution networks. Compared with MPEG-2 encoding, the streaming bit rate is reduced by more than half. By utilizing sophisticated MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) compressing algorithms, the high video fidelity remains to be implemented. As a result, HDTV content can be transmitted at narrow bandwidths over existing DVB satellite or low-cost broadband IP networks.

IP-9500D utilizes auto-sensing 10T/100T/1G Ethernet for IP connectivity as well as ASI I/O ports for connecting to DVB networks. IP-9500D also provides industry standard HD-SDI (SD-SDI) and HDMI I/Os for connecting to HDTV (SDTV). Operating with an IP-9500 encoder, IP-9500D is mainly utilized for delay-sensitive ENG applications. A bidirectional voice intercom's capability is provided across broadband networks for interactive communication among remote HQ and local branches.

This connector displays information on different pages, as described in the **Usage** section of this document.

The connector manages independent counters, and a reset button is available to clear the content of these values as well as the internal counters of the web page of the device.

From version 1.0.0.2, the **DataMiner Connectivity Framework** has been implemented in the connector.
