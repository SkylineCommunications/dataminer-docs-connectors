# Icareus EP100

The Icareus EPG platform is used by broadcasters and network operators to manage multi-platform EPG on a single integrated platform. It generates all the PSI/SI and EIT tables needed for premium DVB networks or to serve the IPTV/OTT middleware platform.

In the 1.0.0.x range, this connector uses a serial connection to communicate with the device to retrieve important KPIs. In range 1.1.0.x, an SNMP connection is used instead.

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination. **Default port: 161.**
