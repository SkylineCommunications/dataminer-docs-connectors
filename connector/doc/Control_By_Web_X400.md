# Control By Web X400

The **Control By Web X400** is a web-enabled programmable logic controller. The modules in the X-4xx series have various combinations of relays, digital inputs, analog inputs, 1-wire bus (for temperature/humidity monitoring), etc. Most of the modules have a fixed number of I/O; however, the X-400 has a ribbon-cable expansion bus, which allows expansion I/O modules to be directly connected to the X-400, making its I/O customizable.

This connector can only be used to monitor information. Traps received will be used to poll the most recent values.

## How to use

Once a valid Username and Password have been specified, content is retrieved and shown in the table.

Rows where the Row Status is "*Not available"* can be deleted automatically if the parameter **Removed Not Available Rows** is set to *Auto,* or manually if this parameter is set to *Manual* (default setting). You can remove a row by clicking the **Delete** button.
