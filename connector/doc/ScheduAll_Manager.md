# ScheduAll Manager

ScheduAll is an application running on Windows OS that manages bookings (a.k.a. work orders) and resources.

## About

This connector allows communication to and from ScheduAll via a web service API and/or via an interop chorus API.

The **web service** API is an XML interface over HTTP. DataMiner can send requests and receives responses accordingly. The interop chorus API works in a different way. Via **interop**, ScheduAll sends data in a specific format to DataMiner without getting a request first (i.e. eventing). The structure of this message is defined via message templates in ScheduAll.

## Configuration

### Connections - Range 2.0.0.x / 2.0.1.x /2.0.3.x

This connector uses **HTTP** to communicate with the ScheduAll services, and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP connection:

- **IP address/host**: The IP address of the main HTTP connection.
- **Port**: The main port the connector will communicate through.

WEB SERVICE API BACKUP connection:

- **IP address/host**: The IP address of the web service API.
- **Port**: The port used for the web service communication.

INTEROP SERVICE connection:

- **IP address/host**: *any*. (Note that if *any* is configured, DataMiner will behave similarly to a server since it will be listening for incoming events on the port configured below.)
- **Port**: The port used for the interop service communication.

INTEROP LISTENER connection:

- **IP address/host**: The IP address of the interop listener.
- **Port**: The port used for the interop listener communication.

> [!NOTE]
> To make sure the ScheduAll Manager has sufficient time to retrieve the information from the **Resource Information** table, increase the timeout to 60s.

### Connections - Range 3.0.0.x / 3.0.1.x / 3.0.2.x

This connector uses a **smart-serial** connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SMART-SERIAL CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

## ScheduAll table structure

The connector combines data coming from several tables in ScheduAll. Below, you can find an overview of the different tables in ScheduAll:

## Usage (range 2.0.0.x / 2.0.1.x)

### General

This page indicates the **ScheduAll status** for both **Web Service** and the **Interop Services**.

### Configuration

This page contains **basic configuration** parameters for both the web and the interop services. It is among others possible to **enable or disable** either of the two services here.

This page includes both the **Task Configuration** and the **Message Fields Configuration**.

The task configuration is used to launch an Automation script when new bookings (or updates) are retrieved.

### Configuration - Web Service

This page contains **communication configuration** parameters related to the web service. This includes the following settings:

- Disabling or enabling the communication with the web service.
- Adjusting the polling time with the **Communication Web Service Polling Time** parameter.
- Disabling or enabling polling of the client info or resource info tables from ScheduAll.
- Time format used by ScheduAll.

> [!NOTE]
> In range 2.0.3.x, additional parameters are available on this page:
>
> - **Resolve DNS Name**: Indicates if the hostname (if specified) should be DNS-resolved. Set to *false* by default.
> - **Dynamic URL**: Base URL path to append to the polling IP/host for each request.
> - **Authentication Provider Username**: Used for setting the username if another authentication layer is used.
> - **Authentication Provider Password**: User for setting the password if another authentication layer is used.
>
> Only the *Basic Auth* authentication type is supported. Username and password are joined with a colon, encoded with Base64 encoding, and set in the *Authorization* header.

#### Timespan configuration

With a start and stop parameter, the size of a sliding window in which data (bookings + resources) have to be retrieved can be defined (in minutes). For example, if you configure a start of -1440 min and a stop of 1440 min, DataMiner is going to retrieve all bookings that have a start or stop time 24 hours before and 24 hours after the current time.

#### Query Configuration

If not all bookings have to be retrieved from ScheduAll but only a subset, this section can be used to define a filter. There are two filters available:

- **Work Order Query Resource Filter**: Only bookings that contain one of the resources defined in this filter will be retrieved.
- **Work Order Query Resource Group Filter**: Only bookings that contain resources that are in the resource group defined in this filter will be retrieved. Note that in order for this to work, the polling of the **Resource Information** table has to be enabled.

The **Message field configuration** allows you to define which data fields from ScheduAll have to be retrieved:

- **Work Order Custom Fields**: Here you can define which fields have to be retrieved in addition to the default fields from the work order table in ScheduAll. Per work order, the values are JSON-encoded and stored in the **Custom WO Fields** column in the **Work Order Overview** table.
- **Query Custom WO USER Fields**: Here you can define which fields have to be retrieved in addition to the default fields from the WO_USER table in ScheduAll. Per work order, the values are JSON-encoded and stored in the **Custom WO USER Fields** column in the **Work Order Overview** table.
- **Resource Custom Fields**: Here you can define which fields have to be retrieved in addition to the default fields from the booking resource table in ScheduAll. Per resource, the values are stored in the **RES Custom xx** columns in the **Resource Overview** table.
- **Query Custom SEVT EX Fields**: Here you can define which additional fields have to be retrieved on top of the default ones from the SEVT_EX table in ScheduAll. Per resource, the values are JSON-encoded and stored in the **Custom SEVT EX Fields** column in the **Resource Overview** table.
- **Query Custom Resource Details Fields**: Here you can define which fields have to be retrieved in addition to the default fields from the Resource Details table in ScheduAll. Per resource, the values are JSON-encoded and stored in the **Custom Resource Details Fields** column in the **Resource Overview** table.
- **Query Custom Client Details Fields**: Here you can define which fields have to be retrieved in addition to the default fields from the client table in ScheduAll. Per resource, the values are JSON-encoded and stored in the **Custom Client Details Fields** column in the **Client Overview** table.
- **Query Custom Values**: Here you can define which fields have to be retrieved in addition to the default fields from the resource info table in ScheduAll. Per resource, the values are stored in the **Custom x** columns in the **Resource Information** table.

#### Query Filtering

It is possible to specify additional filters to append to the WorkOrderQuery filter tag by adding rows to the **Work Order Query Filtering** table. Adding and removing rows is done through the right-click menu of the table. Keys of the table are mapped to ScheduAll field names, which will be used for the filtering. Values can be added as a semicolon-separated list.

For example, if a row is added with key "EXTID" and field value "1;9;4", this is what will be appended to the WorkOrderQuery filter: *AND (EXTID='&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1' OR EXTID='&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9' OR EXTID='&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4')*

You can enable or disable this feature with the **Work Order Query Filter by Field** parameter.

#### External mappings

When the *EventModify* request is used, ScheduAll Manager needs to tie the resource ID (RESID) of a resource booking in ScheduAll with an external ID (EXTID). With the **DataMiner Combined IDS Field** parameter, you can define which parameter from the **Custom Resource Details Fields** will be used as a mapping to the RESID.

### Configuration - Interop Service

This page contains the **interop-specific configuration** parameters. Via the **Credentials** button, you can access a subpage where you can enter **user credentials**. These credentials are the **ScheduAll credentials** that will allow communication between DataMiner and the interop service.

### Configuration - Parameter Mapping

This page contains a table of **Parameter Mapping Names.** Via the right-click menu, you can add extra mapping lines to this table. This table can be used by Automation scripts to map field names from ScheduAll with field names in DataMiner.

### Work Order Overview

This page contains a table of current **work order information**. This table contains an overview of all the information related to the present work orders, and provides the possibility to delete a specific work order.

Note that this page also displays the current **resources scheduled** by ScheduAll.

### Category Overview

This page contains two tables. The table on the left lists all **Category Names**, while the table on the right contains **Category Type** information.

### Client Overview

This page contains a table of **Client Names**.

### Statistics - Web Service

This page contains **web service statistics** for current **queries** and **work orders**.

### Statistics - Interop Service

On this page, a single parameter displays the **Interop Received Time**. In addition, there is a button linking to the **Interop Listener**. The interop listener provides information on the responses DataMiner receives from the interop service.

## Usage (range 2.0.3.x)

### General

This page indicates the **ScheduAll status** for both the **Web Service** and the **Interop Services.**

### Configuration

This page contains **Communication Configuration** parameters for both the **Web Service** and the **Interop Services**, allowing you to **enable** or **disable** the referred services.

The page also includes the **Task Configuration,** which allows you to define the validation of the work orders content as well as the the data used to launch the configured Automation script when new or modified work orders are retrieved.

### Configuration Subpage - Ignored DataMiner Resource Pools

On this subpage, you can configure which resource pools from DataMiner should be ignored upon work order creation.

### Configuration Subpage - Task Automation Script

This subpage contains the configuration of the Automation script specified with the **Task Automation Script Name** parameter on the **Configuration** page. You can specify the following settings:

- **Startup Trigger**: Defines whether the Automation script is triggered at connector startup (*Enabled*) or not (*Disabled*).

- **Default Behavior**: Defines whether the default behavior is enabled or disabled:

  - *Enabled*: The Task Automation Script will be triggered with the default input script parameter: `[ "Work Order ID": WO ID [IDX] ]`. Note that in case the processing state is set to *Bulk*, the referred input script parameter will have a serialized list of "WO ID \[IDX\]".

  - *Disabled*: The Task Automation Script will be triggered according to the data present in the Input Script Parameters table.

- **Processing State**: Defines whether the Task Automation Script processing is *Single* or *Bulk*:

  - *Single*: The Task Automation Script will be triggered individually for each new/modified work order.

  - *Bulk*: The Task Automation Script will be triggered once, receiving as input argument a serialized list of new or modified work orders according to the current configuration of the Input Script Parameters table.

- **Pending Script Processing Buffer**: Defines whether there is a buffer holding the pending work orders to be passed as input script parameter (*Enabled*) or not (*Disabled*):

  - *Enabled*: A buffer will be used to hold the work orders that will be passed as input parameter of the Task Automation Script if the script is still processing those same work orders.

    For example, if there is a running script busy processing "#WO12345", that work order will be stored in the referred buffer.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this option is selected, the Task Automation Script will be responsible for triggering the script again in order to process the pending work orders that have been added, which can be done by setting the pending work order IDs (separated by ;) in the **Work Order IDs Pending Script Processing** parameter (ID=35). The following example illustrates the format in which the work order IDs should be set: `12345;123456;123457`.

  - *Disabled*: The Task Automation Script will be triggered once, receiving as input argument a serialized list of new or modified work orders according to the current configuration of the Input Script Parameters table.

  > [!NOTE]
  > At most five of these scripts can run concurrently. The execution queue can hold up to fifty scripts. These limits cannot be adjusted. These are required to prevent system instability issues.

On this subpage, you can also define the **Input Script Parameters**, which are passed as an argument of the referred Automation script for either new or modified work orders:

- **\[Full WO w/ Resources in JSON\]**: JSON containing new or modified work orders alongside with their associated resources.
- **\[Full WO wo/ Resources in JSON\]**: JSON containing new or modified work orders.
- **SEQNUM \[WO ID\]**: ID of the new or modified work orders.
- **JOBDESC \[WO Description\]**: Clip name of the new or modified work orders.
- **WO_START \[WO Start Time\]**: Start time of the new or modified work orders.
- **WO_END \[WO End Time\]**: End time of the new or modified work orders.
- **STAT \[WO DMS Task State\]**: Mirrors work orders status, which is mapped to the DataMiner booking status through the **Task Status Definition** subpage.
- **STATUSEX \[WO DMS Task State Extended\]**: Mirrors work orders extended status, which is mapped to the DataMiner booking status through the **Task Status Definition** subpage.
- **STAT.STATUSEX \[WO Status\]**: Combined work orders status, as defined on the **Task Status Definition** subpage.
- **WONUM \[WO Number\]**: Number of the work orders.
- **CREATEDBY \[WO Created By\]**: User who has created the work orders.
- **DATECREAT \[WO Date Created\]**: Creation date of the work orders.
- **MOD_BY \[WO Modified By\]**: Last user who has modified the work orders.
- **LAST_MOD \[WO Last Modified\]**: Last modified date of the work orders.
- **CL_ID \[WO Client ID\]**: Client record(s), which can either identify an agency or a contact.

It is also possible to configure which **Work Order Status Transitions** will trigger the referred Automation script. Note that if no transition is defined, the Automation script will be triggered for each work order status change.

- **Previous Status**: Defines the previous work order status for the each configured transition.
- **Current Status**: Defines the current work order status for the each configured transition.
- **Valid Status for New Work Orders**: Defines which status is valid to trigger the Automation script for new work orders. Note that this table column is independent from the other columns and is only applied for new work orders.
- **Valid Status for Existing Work Orders**: Defines which status is valid to trigger the Automation script for existing work orders. Note that this table column is independent from the other columns and is only applied for existing work orders.

### Configuration Subpage - Task Status Definition
