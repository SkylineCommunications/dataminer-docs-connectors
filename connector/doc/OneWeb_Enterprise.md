# OneWeb Enterprise

## About

The OneWeb Enterprise connector enables seamless monitoring of OneWeb's Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite services through HTTP-based APIs using JSON data.

Designed for enterprise environments, it offers real-time insights into key resources such as user terminals, products, organizations, and sites. With visibility on performance metrics and service usage, organizations can optimize operations and ensure reliable satellite connectivity, especially in remote or challenging locations.

## Key Features

### Monitoring of User Terminals

Monitor every connected user terminal with full transparency. Gain instant access to critical identifiers like IMEI and device names, along with real-time visibility on the network state, firmware versions, and hardware configurations. Understand terminal deployments better through geographic coordinates and relationship mapping with distribution partners and site connectivity.

### Monitoring of Products

Track and manage service plan inventory with precision. Each product is tied directly to a distribution partner and a deployment site, offering full traceability. Dive deeper into product usage by linking services to specific user terminals and customer accounts, ensuring you always know who is using what, where, and how.

### Monitoring of Performance

Stay ahead with continuous performance insights. Measure and trend key metrics such as link availability, signal quality, and throughput across both user terminals and products. Identify bottlenecks early, optimize service delivery, and make data-driven decisions backed by historical performance tracking.

### Usage Reports

Track data usage in near real-time to stay in control of monthly allowances. Visualize how consumption evolves throughout the billing cycle with clear breakdowns of entitlements, balances, and overages. Each usage report is product-linked, allowing you to connect the dots back to the responsible User Terminal and site for a complete usage profile.

## Use Case: Real-Time Monitoring and Troubleshooting for Remote Connectivity Sites

A company with operations in remote or infrastructure-limited locations relies on satellite connectivity to ensure stable internet access and continuous monitoring of field sites. Each location is equipped with user terminals connected to the OneWeb LEO satellite network to support essential communication and operational needs. The company faces challenges in **maintaining real-time visibility** on terminal status, performance, and data usage, making it difficult to respond quickly to issues or manage bandwidth efficiently.

By implementing the OneWeb Enterprise connector, the organization **integrates OneWeb telemetry into its centralized monitoring system**. This provides **instant insights into terminal availability, signal strength, and firmware versions**, along with **detailed performance metrics** such as throughput and link reliability. **Real-time usage reporting** helps prevent overages by aligning consumption with service plans. **Historical performance data** supports faster troubleshooting and helps identify recurring issues or external factors impacting service. With a clear link between products, user terminals, and site locations, the company gains **full operational traceability**. As a result, teams can act quickly, ensure service reliability, and maintain uninterrupted connectivity, even in the most challenging environments.
