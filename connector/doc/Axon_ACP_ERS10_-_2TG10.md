# Axon ACP ERS10 - 2TG10

The 2TG100 is a dual-channel test pattern generator. Locked to a black&burst or tri-level sync, it can generate 2 fully independent test patterns in either **3 Gb/s**, **HD** or **SD**. The 16 test signals of embedded audio can be sourced to the Quad Speed audio bus for discrete usage. External audio can also be inserted via the Quad Speed audio bus with for example a DIO88. The fully individual outputs can handle any format with the same frequency. As such, 1080p/50 and 1080i/50 can be used simultaneously.

The **Axon ACP ERS10 - 2TG10** connector can be used to display and configure information of the related device.
