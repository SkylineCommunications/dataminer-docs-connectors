# Imagine Communications DMDP6802+D

The Imagine Communications DMDP6802+D is a data and metadata processing module, supporting 3G, HD, and SD-SDI signals. It converts GPI trigger bit inputs into VANC and/or GPI outputs from VANC. Additionally, it supports the insertion and extraction of metadata in one card and provides dual independent metadata processing channels. This connector can be used to monitor, trend, and control the DMDP6802+D.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **Bus Address**: X.Y, where X = Frame Number and Y = slot number.

#### Serial IP Connection - PortDev Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: "any", meaning the device will reply in broadcast mode.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The DMDP6802+ can simultaneously insert or extract the following metadata:

- ISC (Inter-Station Control)
- Time Code (ATC_LTC, ATC_VITC, D-VITC, LTC)
- Closed Captioning (CC608, CC708)
- Teletext (WST, OP47)
- SCTE104
- AFD (AFD, VI, WSS)

It can transmit three types of ANC packets to carry GPI information: ISC (Inter-Station Control), ATC, or SCTE104 (license keys are required for enabling ATC and SCTE104 capability). The DMDP6802+ module converts GPI trigger bits in the SDI signal to GPI signals, or it converts the GPI signals to trigger bits.
