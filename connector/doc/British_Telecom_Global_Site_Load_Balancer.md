## How to Use

To be able to use the control table, you will need to fill in the **username** and **password** on the **Configurations** page.

In the **Host Mapping** Table, add the location name and IP address for each location. In the **Load Balancer** table, fill in the right Site URL for each location. If the location name is not filled in or if it is not filled in the Host Mapping table, the site status will become ***Not Listed***. On the **Import Host Mapping** page, you can import a **CSV file** to update the **Host Mapping** table. This is also available with the **Import Host Mapping** button just above this table.

You can enable or disable the URL checks and change the polling interval.
The **Control** table gives you functionality to start and stop a server.

The **log** file is located in the **Documents** tab.
