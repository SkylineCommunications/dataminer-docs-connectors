## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (fixed value: *2071*).
  - **Bus address**: The bus address or slot number/position of the card in the frame.

#### Serial IP Connection - Events Connection

This connector uses a smart-serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SMART-SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (fixed value: *2071*).
  - **Bus address**: The bus address or slot number/position of the card in the frame.

## How to use

The element has the following pages:

- **General**: This page displays general information about the card: Card Name, Card Description, SW Revision, HW Revision, etc.
- **Status**: This page contains status parameters.
- **I/O**: This page contains input/output control parameters that are used to configure the I/O settings of the card.
- **Video**: This page contains control parameters used to configure the video settings of the card.
- **Audio**: This page contains audio status information for each individual channel, as well as control parameters to configure the audio settings of the card.
- **Alarm Priority**: This page displays the event messages of the card, i.e. special messages generated asynchronously on the card.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The **1.0.0.x** connector range of the Axon ACP HVD10 protocol supports the usage of DCF and can only be used on a DMA with **8.5.4** as the minimum version.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

### Interfaces

#### Fixed interfaces

Physical fixed interfaces:

- **HVD10 SDI Input**: A single fixed interface of type **in**.
- **HVD10 SDI Output 1**: A single fixed interface of type **out**.
- **HVD10 SDI Output 2**: A single fixed interface of type **out**.
- **HVD10 SDI Reclocked Output**: A single fixed interface of type **out**.
