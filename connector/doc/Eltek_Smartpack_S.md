# Eltek Smartpack S

The Eltek Smartpack S is a controller that allows you to monitor and control DC power systems.

Information is polled from the device using SNMP calls. In addition, the original web interface of the device is available through the connector.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP main connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *private*.

#### HTTP secondary connection (only available in range 1.0.1.x)

This connector also uses a secondary HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *80*).
- **Bus address**: The proxy server to be bypassed (default: *bypassproxy).*

### Configuration of credentials to retrieve logging (range 1.0.1.x)

When the element goes in timeout, it will wait until it can retrieve the log file from the device and update the element with the data available in the file.
However, for this feature to work, you need to make sure valid **credentials** for the web interface are specified on the System Overview page, as well as the **name** of the log file. Note that you need to specify the **encode password**.

### Configuration of normal or lite mode

This connector can be run in **NORMAL** mode (default) or in **LITE** mode. In **LITE** mode, only a very limited number of parameters is polled, so that less data traffic is generated.

To toggle between **NORMAL** mode and **LITE** mode, click the **LITE Protocol** toggle button on the **System Overview** page.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

The connector consists of different pages that cover the various subsections that can be monitored/controlled for this device. You can find more information on these below.

### System Overview

This page displays general information about the device, such as the general **Status**, the physical **Location**, **Information** about the **System Model**, and the **Units** that are used.

In range **1.0.1.x**, an **Access Configuration** section is available, where you can specify the credentials and the name of the log file to retrieve in case the element goes into timeout. The **Status of the Element** is also displayed here. With the **Force Fetch Log** button, you can manually trigger the retrieval of the log file; however, this will only work if the element is in timeout.

In version **1.0.1.3**, the possibility is added to set the web interface address using the parameter **Device HTTP IP**.
