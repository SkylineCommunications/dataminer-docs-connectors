# Evertz 570NAT-HW-X19-25G

The 570-NAT-X19-25G is a high-density, multi-port, multi-flow hardware Network Address Translation (NAT) engine. It is conceptually organized as 6 WAN-side ports + 6 LAN-side ports, with a packet processing core between each WAN-LAN pair. A given processing core can sustain up to 256 data flows, configurable based on multicasts or VLAN tags. It can also accommodate 25 Gb and use any or all of the six NAT core processors, which may be paired for automatic failover. The total throughput is higher than 1536 multicast/VLAN flows.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

SNMP gets and sets are used to retrieve information from the device and display it in tables, as well as to modify values.

The table information in this connector is shown in the same format as the native user interface of the device.

- The **General** page shows the system information and two buttons that allow you to perform a system reboot or a factory reset.
- The **Control Port Configuration** page shows the IP, MAC, Net-Mask, and Gateway address of the device.
- The **Traffic Monitoring** page shows the total bitrate received by WAN and LAN ports and also reports the temperature on the FPGA of the card.
- A series of tables show information about the number of cores and their mode of operation, about the port configuration, and about the interfaces related to each port.
- Six tables, one per core, display information regarding the InputFlow Configuration and the Address Translation Configuration for WAN to LAN and LAN to WAN.
- The **SNMP Polling Table** can be used to adjust the polling frequency of each table. In case values have been changed, a default values button below the table allows you to set the table to the default values again.
