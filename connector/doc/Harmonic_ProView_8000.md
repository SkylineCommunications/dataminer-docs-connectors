### Inputs Page

The Inputs page gives an overview of the physical inputs of the Harmonic ProView 8000 device. The Harmonic ProView 8000 supports three input types: DVB-S/S2, GbE and ASI. For each input type, a table is included containing monitored parameters (e.g. the DVB-S/S2 Input Table contains parameters such as Symbol Rate, Attenuation, C/N, Eb/N0, BER, PER, Carrier Frequency, etc.).

#### Inputs \> LNB

The LNB page button allows you to switch between the DVB-S/S2 ports. LNB can only be enabled for one RF input. The default is RF-1.

#### Inputs \> DVB-S/S2 Properties

The Properties page button below the DVB-S/S2 Inputs Table allows you to configure a DVB-S/S2 port. In order to set a parameter for a given DVB-S/S2 port, first select the port using the **DVB-S/S2 Port** parameter.

The following properties can be set for a DVB-S/S2 port:

- **Modulation Standard**: Allows you to select the L-band modulation standard. Available options are *Automatic*, *DVB-S* and *DVB-S2*.

- **Symbol Rate**: Sets the L-band symbol rate. Range: 01. - 45. Msym/s.

- **Spectral Inversion**: Allows you to select the mode of operation for the spectral inversion function.

- **Modulation & FEC**: Allows you to select the modulation type and coding rate, according to the selected modulation standard.

  For DVB-S, one of the following must be selected: *QPSK 1/2*, *QPSK 2/3*, *QPSK 3/4*, *QPSK 5/6* or *QPSK 7/8*.

  When DVB-S2 is used, one of the following must be selected: *QPSK 1/2, QPSK 2/3, QPSK 3/4, QPSK 5/6, QPSK 3/5, QPSK 4/5, QPSK 8/9, QPSK 9/10, 8PSK 3/5, QPSK 2/3, 8PSK 3/4, 8PSK 5/6, 8PSK 8/9* or *8PSK 9/10*.

In order to apply the changes, click the **Apply** button. This will write the parameters displayed on this subpage to the device.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Once you start to change parameter settings, the polling of platform parameters will be postponed until you have clicked **Apply**. Then the parameters will be written to the device and information will be polled again.
> - In case you have started to modify parameters and **5 minutes** go by without any further parameter configuration changes, the connector will start to the platform data again. Consequently, any **parameter configuration changes will be lost**.
> - Applying changes can take some time, so it is possible that changes will only be visible after some time.

#### Inputs \> GbE Port Properties

The Properties page button below the GbE Input Ports Table allows you to configure a GbE port. To set a parameter for a given GbE port, first select the port using the **GbE Input** **Port** parameter.

The following properties can be set for a GbE port:

- **GbE Port Enable**: You can enable either or both GbE ports. This parameter only works when the redundancy mode is manual. If both ports are enabled, then only one port is active while the other one is in standby mode. By default port 1 is active and port 2 is on standby. The port on standby does not pass data. When the port is enabled and no link is detected, the device reports a Link Down alarm. Disable the port to mask this alarm. (Default is *Disabled*.)

- **GbE Port IP Address**: Each port must have a different IP address. Default: *127.127.X.X*, where X is the port number +1.

- **GbE Port Subnet Mask**: The IP mask. Default: *255.255.255.0*.
