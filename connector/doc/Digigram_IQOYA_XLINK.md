## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

#### HTTP Connection (1.0.2.x onwards)

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: 443.
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The element has the following data pages:

- **General**: Displays general system parameters such as the **Serial Number**, **Firmware Version** and **Device Name**.

  The **Network** subpage displays information about the **Ethernet Interfaces** and the **VLAN Interfaces**.

- **Encoder**: Contains **Encoder Programs** information.

  The **Service 1** subpage displays information about the service 1 available in the device.

- **Decoder**: Displays information about the **Decoder Programs**.

  The **Receivers Priority** subpage displays information about the receivers. It allows you to filter the receiver priorities for the program index 1.

From range **1.0.1.x** onwards, additional pages are available that make the connector more similar to the web interface: the **Receive**, **Send** and **Audio** pages.

The **Display All "*Table Name*"** toggle buttons allow you to select if unused table entries should be hidden. If this toggle button is disabled, only the active table entries are displayed.

From range **1.0.2.x** onwards, an **Receive** configuration page is available, containing the HTTP authentication parameters and a toggle button to enable/disable the Multicast HTTP set.
