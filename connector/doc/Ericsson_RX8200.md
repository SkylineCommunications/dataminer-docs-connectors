# Ericsson RX8200

This is an SNMP connector that shows the status of the different parameters of an **Ericsson RX8200 receiver**.

## About

The **Ericsson RX8200** is a very versatile piece of equipment. It comes in many different configurations, in which input and output options vary between IP, satellite, combo (satellite and IP), VSB, and ASI. In case of a combo type, a primary and secondary input can be specified.

This connector allows the capturing of **traps** of type **No TS Lock**. The info related to the TS lock status is used to update the **TS Lock** **status** **parameter**. The IP to which the trap messages are sent can be configured in the **Trap Server** **table**, which contains the list of servers supporting the device.

## Installation and Configuration

### Creation

#### SNMP main connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*
- **Device address**: Not needed.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161.*
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private*.

#### Serial connection

Ranges 2.0.1.x and 3.0.0.x require a second, TCP/IP connection.

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*
- **Port**: The port used by the device for its web interface, normally this is *80.*

### Configuration

In the 3.1.0.x range, from version 3.1.0.20 onwards, the timers have been replaced by a single timer, which checks if the "timer" interval for each of the previous timers has been reached. The timer intervals can be configured on the **Polling Configuration** page.

In the 3.0.0.x range, from version 3.0.0.15 onwards, and in the 3.1.0.x range, from version 3.1.0.26 onwards, you can choose whether to display the **PID+Name** or only the **PID** on the Decode Audio page.
