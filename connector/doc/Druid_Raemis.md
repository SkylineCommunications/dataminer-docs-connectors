# Druid Raemis

Raemis is a technology platform by Druid Software that harnesses 5G, 4G, 3G, 2G, and Wi-Fi radios to implement standalone cellular core network solutions.

The Druid Raemis connector monitors this platform, by enlisting active alarms and also implementing a heartbeat mechanism that evaluates the liveliness of the Raemis platform.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection - Main

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *443*).

#### SNMP Connection - Traps

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Initialization

For the HTTP connection, you need to configure the API authentication: go the **General** page, and configure the **Username** and **Password**.

On that same page, you can also configure the proxy server.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The **Active Alarms** table on the Alarms page fetches the information from the REST API.

The **heartbeat mechanism** is based on receiving a specific, periodic SNMP trap (heartbeat). If the time between heartbeats is greater than the configured Heartbeat Delay parameter, an alarm is raised (with the Heartbeat Status parameter).
