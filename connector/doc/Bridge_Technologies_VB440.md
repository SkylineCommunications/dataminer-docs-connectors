## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default value: *80*).
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

#### SNMP Traps Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Initialization

Once the element has been created in DataMiner, the **Element Configuration** page allows you to configure different aspects of the element behavior:

- Configuring credentials for **HTTP Authentication** (if HTTP authentication is enabled on the probe).
- Configuring how to handle probe alarms.
- Enable more verbose logging if needed.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The **Streams** page contains tables regarding grouped stream data, while more detailed statistical information can be found on the **Media Window** page.
