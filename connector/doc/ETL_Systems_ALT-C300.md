#### SNMP main connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The IP address of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13*.
- **Device address**: Not required.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device. The default value is *private*.

## Usage

### General

This page displays general parameters such as **System Description**, **Contact** and **Name**, as well as a **Summary Alarm**.

The page also contains the following three buttons:

- **Init Nr Modules:** Allows you to initialize the number of modules in the device.
- **Factory Reset:** Resets the device to the factory defaults.
- **Reboot**: Reboots the device.

### System
