## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **Device address**: Not required.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: 161.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

#### Serial Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: 23.
  - **Bus address**: Not required.

### Initialization

In order to be able to remove an SSL VPN tunnel, click the **Credentials** page button and fill in the **Fortinet Username** and **Fortinet Password**.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.
