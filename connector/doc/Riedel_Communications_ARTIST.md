# Riedel Communications ARTIST

## About

**Riedel Communications ARTIST** is a powerful, modular, and decentralized digital matrix intercom platform that forms the communications backbone for broadcasting, live events, and command/control environments around the world. The Riedel Artist network infrastructure can be managed and configured using DataMiner, showcasing seamless integration capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized & Scalable Architecture**: Connect multiple nodes via fiber or IP together with seamless integration across facilities, regions, or campuses.
- **Non-Blocking Digital Audio Routing**: Up to 1024 x 1024 full-duplex ports per node with real-time, ultra-low latency routing.
- **IP-Native Connectivity**: Works with AES67, Dante, ST 2110
- **Modular Design**: Customize for any scale or use case (AES, MADI, VoIP, analog, Dante, and more)
- **DataMiner Integration**: Utilize the DataMiner connector, which uses a TCP/IP connection to retrieve and configure the matrix, enhancing management and operational efficiency.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Live Broadcast Production
