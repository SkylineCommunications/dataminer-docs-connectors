| 2.0.0.x [SLC Main] | Changed protocol name to the correct name "Digigram" instead of "Digiram". | 1.0.0.2 | Live Update will be broken. Elements will need to use the new connector, which means that existing configurations for monitoring, reports, filters, and Automation scripts may need to be modified. If you are using an "allowed protocols" license, your license may need to be adjusted. |

- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use
