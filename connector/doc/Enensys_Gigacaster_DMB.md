### Creation

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161.*
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *private*.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The element created with this connector consists of the data pages described below.

### General

This page contains information about the device itself:

- Identification, e.g. **Device Name**, **Device Type**, **Device Serial Number**, etc.
- Hardware status, e.g. **Product Mode**, **Current Temperature**, etc.
- Generic alarm information: **Current Status**, **Alarm Current Count**.
- Date and time: **Date Time ISO**, **Date Time Unix**.
- Options: **Device Option Table**.

The page also allows you to restart the multiplexer with the **Reboot Device** button, or to reset it by entering *confirm* in the **Device Factory Reset** box. You can also have all parameters polled again with the button **Refresh all Values**.
