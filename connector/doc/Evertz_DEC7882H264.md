# Evertz DEC7882H264

The 7882 Decoder H264 is a platform capable of HD/SD-SDI/H.264/MPEG-2 dual decoding and offers decoding support for both MPEG-2 and H.264/AVC, optionally up to 4:2:2 10-bit.

The 7882 Decoder H264 features:

- 2x H.264/MPEG-2 video decoder up to 4:2:2 10-bit
- 2x ASI and IP inputs
- 4x HD/SD-SDI outputs
- Baseband outputs with embedded audio an ancillary data

This connector uses **SNMP** to poll data from the Evertz DEC7882H264 based on the decoder web interface layout.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use
