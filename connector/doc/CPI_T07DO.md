## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **Type of Port**: TCP/IP
  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device, by default *50000*.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device, by default *48*.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The element has the following data pages:

- **General**: Displays general information about the device. Via the **Set Time** page button, you can set the **Amplifier** **Name and** the **Time** of the device.
- **Amplifier Status**: Allows you to visualize several measurement points related to the amplifier and configure some important features on the device.
- **Switch Controller**: Displays information related to the switch controller. You can also change the switch controller settings here.
- **Set Points**: Use this page to set the fault and alarm trip points. Use the **Limits** page button to check the limits of the device before an alarm or fault is triggered.
- **System Status**: Allows you to check any fault on the device.
- **Alarm**: Displays the active alarms.
- **Log**: Allows you to log entries from the device. To do so, first set the **Log Entry Number To Get** and then the **Log Entry Units To Get**. Click **Get Entry** to send the command to the device. If you retrieve the same entry number but with different units, this will overwrite the row with the same entry number.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The **1.2.0.x** connector range of the CPI T07DO protocol supports the usage of DCF and can only be used on a DMA with **8.5.4** as the minimum version.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).
