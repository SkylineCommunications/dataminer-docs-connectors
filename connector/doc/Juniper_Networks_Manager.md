# Juniper Networks Manager

This is an SNMP-based connector used to monitor and configure the Juniper Networks Manager. With this connector, the device settings can be monitored and changed.

The connector also uses an SSH connection, in order to change the interface state of some ports.

Some devices have huge tables, so in order to limit polling, polling can be disabled for some tables.

## Configuration

### Connections

This is an SNMP and SSH connector. The IP has to be configured during creation of the element.

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13*.

SNMP settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private*.

SSH settings:

- **IP address:** The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13*.
- **Port number**: The SSH port of the connected device, by default *23* or *22* (version 1.0.3.x).

#### Supported Pages

#### Real-Time Performance Monitoring (RPM)

New RPM Metrics page includes:

### Initialization

For the **SSH** communication, a **user name** and **password** need to be set. To do so, go to the **General** page and click the **Credentials** page button on the right-hand side page.

By default, all tables in this connector are polled. However, in order to reduce the amount of polling, the polling of some tables can be stopped, and some tables have a number of columns for which polling can be disabled and enabled:

- On the **General page**, there is a page button to get to the **Redundancy** **Table**, and there you can find a button **Poll Redundancy Table**. This button can be set to *Disabled* to stop the polling of this table.
- On the **General page**, there is a page button to get to the **Operating** **Table**, and there you can find a button **Poll Operating Table**. This button can be set to *Disabled* to stop the polling of this table.
- On the **Interface Stats page**, there is a button **Poll Optional Interface Stats**. This button can be set to *Disabled* to stop the polling of some of the columns of the Interface Stats table.

Version range 1.0.2.x has some extra features:

- **Polling Config** (on the General page): This page contains a **Polling Configuration Table**, which can be used to configure the polling speed for each table. If you set the **PCT - Polling Time** to *disabled (-1)*, no polling is done for these parameters. With the **Refresh** button, you can poll the parameters manually. In range 1.0.9.x, each row has a unique toggle button to switch between enabling and disabling polling. Initially, this column will display *Not Initialized* upon element creation. When polling is set to enabled, the polling time will automatically be set to 5 minutes.

- **Measurement Config** (on the Interfaces page):

- **Manually**: Disable interfaces in the **Measurement Configuration Table** by toggling the **MCT - Measure Port** column. A disabled interface is no longer polled and is removed from the different interface tables. This is useful to reduce the load in case of huge interface tables. By setting the **Enable/Disable Interface \[Description Filter\]** with a string value, you can enable/disable all interfaces that contain the string value. With the buttons **Disable All**, **Enable All**, and **Enable Oper. Up** you can disable all interfaces, enable all interfaces, or enable all operational interfaces.
  - **MCT - Filter Table**: Adding a filter description in this table (by selecting Add in the right-click menu) will enable all interfaces containing part of the filter and disable all other interfaces. Each entry in this table can be activated/deactivated. Only when this table is empty, can the **Measurement Configuration Table** be changed manually.

- **LSP-MPLS**: This page displays a table with information regarding the list of configured **Label Switched Paths (LSP)**.

- New **traps** have been added in order to update the parameters directly or to trigger the polling for the affected parameters based on the bindings in the trap.

Version range 3.0.0.x has additional features:

- **Polling Configuration Table** (on the Polling Config subpage of the General page):

- Contains an additional **Lock State** column, which can contain the value *Locked or Unlocked*. When a row is **locked**, no change can be performed to the **Polling Time** and **Polling State** parameters, and the **Refresh** button is disabled. A locked row will contain a letter in a dark grey color to indicate the locked state. The **right-click menu** of the table can be used to lock or unlock a row or multiple selected rows.
  - When the **Real-Time Performance Monitoring: Ping Results** row is disabled, no action will be performed on the row, and a message will be displayed if some of its dependent tables are enabled (see "RPM Metrics Page \[1.0.3.x\]" below). When such dependent tables are enabled, Real-Time Performance Monitoring: Ping Results will become *enabled* if it was set to *disabled* and a message will be displayed.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## Usage

### General Page

This page displays general information regarding the system, such as the **System Name**, **System Uptime**, **CPU Usage**, **Memory Usage**, etc.

There are several page buttons, which lead to pages that display more information about **Services**, **Redundancy**, the **Operating Table**, **TCP/UDP Stats**, **ICMP Stats**, **IP Stats**, and **SSH Security Settings**:

### Backup / Restore

Backup procedure: The **Backup File Name** is copied via **SCP** command from the **Backup Device Directory** to the **Backup Remote Directory**. For instance:

- The *juniper.conf.gz* file will be copied via the SCP command (example below) from the */config/* backup device directory to the *10.10.132.18:~/* backup remote directory.
- Command: scp /config/juniper.gz user@10.10.132:~/juniper.conf.gz

Restore procedure: The **Restore File Name** is copied via **SCP** command from the **Restore Remote Directory** to the **Restore Device Directory**. Once the file is copied to the device, it is **committed** to the device. For instance:

- The *juniper.conf.gz* file will be copied via the SCP command (example below) from the *10.10.132.18:~/* restore remote directory to the */tmp/* restore device directory.
- Command: scp user@10.10.132.18:~/juniper.conf.gz /tmp/juniper.conf.gz

The **Restore Timeout** parameter can be used to configure how long it will take before the **Restore Commit command** is considered to have timed out.

### Firmware Upgrade

The **Upgrade File Name** is copied via **SCP** command from the **Upgrade Remote Directory** to the **Upgrade Device Directory**. Once the file is copied to the device, there will be a **load override** with added validation. In case no issues occur, the file will be **committed**, after which a system **reboot** will take place in order to complete the firmware upgrade.

For instance:

- The *jinstall-xxx.nnn-domestic-signed.tgz* file will be copied via the SCP command (example below) from the *192.168.10.1:~/* upgrade remote directory to the */tmp/* upgrade device directory.
- Command: scp user@192.168.10.1:~/jinstall-xxx.nnn-domestic-signed.tgz /tmp/

The **Upgrade Timeout** parameter can be used to configure how long it will take before the **Upgrade** is considered to have timed out.

From version 1.0.3.7 onwards, a **Software Rollback** button is available.

### Web Interface

This page can be used to access the web interface of the device. Note that the client machine has to be able to access the device, as otherwise it will not be possible to open the web interface.
