## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*
- **Device address**: Not needed.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161.*
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private*.

#### HTTP connection

Ranges 2.0.1.x and 2.0.2.x use a second, TCP/IP connection. This requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy*.

### Web Interface

In case the web interface requires a username and password, these should be entered on the **Device Info** \> **Credentials** page.

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product

### Web Interface

This page contains a link to the webpage of the actual device. Note that the client machine has to be able to access the device, as otherwise it will not be possible to open the web interface.

## Notes

**When the Input Source, Primary Input or Secondary Input is changed, a wait time of 1.5 seconds is implemented**, to ensure that the related parameters are up to date on the device.

Because of the versatility of the equipment, not all parameters will be filled in. If, for instance, your device is only IP-based, the Sat options will not be filled in.
