## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

Interface connection:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *50*).
- **Bus address**: The bus address of the device (default: *0000*, range: *0000* - *9999*).

### Initialization

By default, *Telnet* (TCP) will be selected as the **Connection Mode**. The default password (0000) will be used to log in.
The **Connection Mode** can be changed in the **Connection Settings** page available via the **Connect** page button on the **General** page.
It is possible to switch this mode between *Telnet* (TCP) and *Serial* (RS232/RS485).

The **Polling Status** will indicate if data is being retrieved. For example: when it is not possible to log in via the Telnet, the **Polling Status** will indicate *Disabled* and no data will be retrieved until the Telnet connection could be established.
An automatic log in attempt is done every hour.

## How to use

In case the **Connection Mode** is set to *Telnet*, the log in session must succeed before data is retrieved. This will be indicated via the **Polling Status**.
When during polling via Telnet would return a Timeout or an unsupported message, a re-login attempt will be executed. This because a timeout closes the Telnet session.
In case the re-login would time out the retrieval of data is stopped and the **Polling Status** set to *Disabled* until the automatic re-login or a manual log in was successful.

## Notes

When no data is being retrieved / updated, always first check the **Polling Status**. When this is indicating *Disabled* it means the Telnet session could not log in.

Using a serial connection requires correct serial configuration before communication is possible.
These settings are dong in the communication interface that links the data source with the network.

- Serial settings:

  - **Baudrate**: Baudrate specified in the manual of the device, e.g. *9600*.
  - **Databits**: Databits specified in the manual of the device, e.g. *7*.
  - **Stopbits**: Stopbits specified in the manual of the device, e.g. *1*.
  - **Parity**: Parity specified in the manual of the device, e.g. *No*.
  - **FlowControl**: FlowControl specified in the manual of the device, e.g. *No*.
