# Skyline SSPA Simulation Technical

## About

The Skyline SSPA Simulation connector simulates an SSPA, allowing you to adjust input power, gain, and attenuation, and view calculated output values.

## Configuration

### Connections

This connector uses a virtual connection and requires no setup during element creation.

## How to Use

The **General page** provides access to SSPA parameters such as input power, attenuation, and gain, and displays the resulting output power.
