## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to use

Use the **IDP_Helper_DVE_Connectivity** script as a starting point to start using this connector. The script will get the interfaces/ports information of the elements and send it to the COX IDP EPM Connectivity element. This element will then process the data and start creating DCF connections between non-CI Type elements.

The connector contains two main tables:

- The **Mapping** table, which contains element information (Chassis ID, Agent ID, Element ID).
- The **Connections** table, which contains interfaces/ports information (Port ID, DCF ID).
