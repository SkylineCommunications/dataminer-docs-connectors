# Siselectron SR1

## About

This is a DataMiner connector for the **Siselectron SR1**, a rack mount server that utilizes Synamedia's Media Edge Gateway, which can be used for decoding, encoding, and transcoding/processing.

### Key Features

- **Channel monitoring and editing**: Look through each of the channels on the device, monitor them to detect changes on critical parameters, and edit their input, descrambling, video, audio, and output settings.
- **Encoder and decoder settings**: Monitor and change any encoder and decoder settings on the device.
- **Configuration**: Go through the Licenses, PCIe cards, and Alarm History of the device.

## Use Cases

### Remote Monitoring of Device Alarms

**Challenge:** In large, distributed systems, monitoring and managing device alarms remotely can be a challenge, particularly for maintaining system reliability.

**Solution:** With this connector, you can remotely set and manage alarm thresholds for channels, encoders, decoders, and more. This enables proactive monitoring and reduces the risk of unexpected system failures.

**Benefit:** Potential issues can be quickly addressed in real time, improving the reliability and performance of network operations.

## Prerequisites

- **DataMiner version 10.2 or higher** is required.
- **Network access**: You must have a username and password for the device to be able to log in on the **Authentication** page of the element, so that the connector can retrieve data from the device.
