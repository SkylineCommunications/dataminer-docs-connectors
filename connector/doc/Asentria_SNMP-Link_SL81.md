# Asentria SNMP-Link SL81

The **SNMP-Link SL81** is a device that performs three basic functions to facilitate the management and monitoring of both serial port devices and environmental conditions:

- Remote access of connected serial devices
- Monitoring of serial and environmental event conditions
- Monitoring of connected sensor devices (contact inputs, voltage inputs, relay outputs, temperature sensor)

The SNMP-Link SL81 connector monitors the sensors and their events.
