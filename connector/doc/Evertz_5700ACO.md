# Evertz 5700ACO

This connector is used to monitor and control the **Evertz 5700ACO** device.

The 5700ACO automatic changeovers are intended for use with two 5700MSC master clock/sync generators. The 5700ACO system uses mechanically latching relays to ensure maximum reliability and minimal disruption in the event of any failure, even power failures.

The changeover uses a voting system based on which source has the best signals and on whether the good signals on the current master are also present on the backup master.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The connector has two main pages, the **General** page and the **Control** page.

- The **General** page contains device status parameters, such as **Firmware Version** and **Operation Mode**.
- The **Control** page is used to change the device configuration. You can for example configure the voting process and change the **Control Status** to manual/automatic.
