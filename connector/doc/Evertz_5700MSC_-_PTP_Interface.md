## Configuration

### Initialization

You can create an element by going to the **PTP DVE** page of the parent connector [Evertz 5700MSC](xref:Connector_help_Evertz_5700MSC) and enabling an interface.

## Usage

On the PTP Controls page, you can find the PTP **Engines table** with **GMP**, **Mode**, **Sync Rate**, **Timeout**, **State**, and other parameters.

On the Status page, the **PTP State** table contains the **Grandmaster** values for the corresponding interface. You can also find PTP parameters here, such as **Priorities**, **Metadata**, **Domain**, **Drop Frame**, **Color Frame**, **Jam Time**, **Time Zone**, and **Frame Rate**. These are status parameters that can also be found in the main element.

This DVE does not have a web interface page. To see the web interface of the device, go to the main element.

## Notes

This is a virtual element that represents an interface instance in the device.
