# xFusion iBMC

## About

Intelligent Baseboard Management Controller (iBMC) is an *embedded server management system* used to manage servers throughout their lifecycles.
The xFusion iBMC connector gives a single overview of the iBMC, allows users to configure basic settings and monitor server health throughout its lifecycle.

## Key Features

- **24/7 monitoring**: Constant monitoring to support continious real-time status updates.

- **Real-time event and alarm tracking**: Instantly capture SNMP traps and maintain an up-to-date list of active alarms for the monitored iBMC device. Automatically clear alarms when issues are resolved, ensuring accurate system health information.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1

**Challenge**: A critical server overheats, but the issue is only detected during the next scheduled check, causing downtime.

**Solution**: With SNMP trap integration, the connector immediately reports the overheating event and adds it to the active alarms list.

**Benefit**: Faster response and reduced downtime.
