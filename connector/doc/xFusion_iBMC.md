# xFusion iBMC

## About

The Intelligent Baseboard Management Controller (iBMC) is an **embedded server management system** used to manage servers throughout their lifecycles. The xFusion iBMC connector provides a unified overview of the iBMC, allowing users to configure basic settings and monitor server health throughout its lifecycle.

## Key Features

- **24/7 monitoring**: Constant monitoring to support continuous real-time status updates.

- **Real-time event and alarm tracking**: Instantly capture SNMP traps and maintain an up-to-date list of active alarms for the monitored iBMC device. Automatically clear alarms when issues are resolved, ensuring accurate system health information.

## Use Case

**Challenge**: A critical server overheats, but the issue is only detected during the next scheduled check, causing downtime.

**Solution**: With SNMP trap integration, the connector immediately reports the overheating event and adds it to the active alarms list.

**Benefit**: Faster responses and reduced downtime.
