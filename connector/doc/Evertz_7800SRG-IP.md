# Evertz 7800SRG-IP

## About

**7800SRG-IP** is a PTP Slave Sync Generator designed for precision timing in hybrid IP-baseband environments. It generates six independently timed sync outputs, locked to an upstream PTP grandmaster clock, and supports black burst, tri-level sync, and continuous wave signals. Installed in an Evertz 7800 series frame, it ensures accurate synchronization for remote edit suites, IP-based broadcast facilities, and legacy baseband equipment.

### Key Features

- **Precision timing synchronization**: Generates six independently timed sync outputs, locked to an upstream PTP grandmaster clock, ensuring accurate synchronization in hybrid IP-baseband environments.

- **Versatile output configuration**: Supports black burst, tri-level sync, continuous wave signals, and word clock, providing flexible timing solutions for broadcast, media production, and legacy baseband equipment.

## Use Cases

### Seamless Synchronization for Hybrid IP and Baseband Broadcast Workflows

**Challenge**: A broadcast facility transitioning to an IP-based infrastructure needs to maintain precise synchronization between legacy baseband equipment and new IP workflows without a large coaxial sync distribution system.

**Solution**: The 7800SRG-IP locks to a PTP grandmaster clock over Ethernet and provides six independent sync outputs, configurable as black burst, tri-level sync, or continuous wave signals to match the facilityâ€™s timing requirements.

**Benefit**: Ensures seamless synchronization between IP and baseband systems, reducing the need for extensive coaxial cabling while maintaining compatibility with legacy video equipment.

### Cost-Effective Sync Solution for Remote Production and Editing Suites

**Challenge**: A remote production studio requires a reliable sync source for multiple editing suites, but installing a traditional GPS-based master clock is impractical because of cost and infrastructure limitations.

**Solution**: The 7800SRG-IP derives timing from a PTP network source and distributes precise sync signals to each editing suite, eliminating the need for expensive external master clock systems.

**Benefit**: Provides a cost-effective and scalable synchronization solution, ensuring frame-accurate editing and smooth video playback without requiring a dedicated grandmaster clock at the remote site.

## Technical info

### Prerequisites

- **DataMiner version 10.2 or higher** is required for compatibility with the 7800SRG-IP connector.
