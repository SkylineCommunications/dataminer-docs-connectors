# Newtec Dialog Local Infrastructure

## About

This integration allows you to monitor PDU devices on different hosts.

## Key Features

- **Monitor your PDUs**: Track real-time power consumption, voltage, current, and outlet states. Quickly detect overloads or failures to maintain continuous and reliable operation.
- **Create a separate DVE for a host**: Get a clear view of the real-time power consumption, voltage, and current for each host, shown in a separate element.

## Use Cases

- **Energy cost optimization**: Track power consumption per host to estimate operational costs and identify possible energy savings.

- **Preventing overloads and power failures**: Monitor current, voltage, and load on each outlet to detect when equipment is drawing too much power. This helps prevent tripped breakers, overheating, or sudden power loss.
