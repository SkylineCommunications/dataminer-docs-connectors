# Newtec Dialog Local Infrastructure

## About

This integration allows you to monitor PDU devices on different hosts.

## Key Features

- **Monitor your PDUs**: Track real-time power consumption, voltage, current, and outlet states. Quickly detect overloads or failures to maintain continuous and reliable operation.
- **Create a seperate DVE for a host**: Clearer view of the real-time power consumptiom,voltage, current as it will be shown in a seperate element.

## Use Cases

**Energy Cost Optimization**: Track power consumption per host to estimate operational costs and identify areas for energy savings.

**Preventing Overloads and Power Failures**: Monitor current, voltage, and load on each outlet to detect when equipment is drawing too much power. This helps prevent tripped breakers, overheating, or sudden power loss.
