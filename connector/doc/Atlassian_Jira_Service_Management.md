## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *443*).
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

Fill in the **Username** and **API Key** on the **General** page. Basic authentication with passwords is deprecated, and instead of the password an **API token needs to be used** (see also [Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account \| Atlassian Support](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/)).

## How to use

The element polls all service desks for the environment specified in the URL of the element. This includes the **Service Desks**, **Queues**, and **Issues**. You can choose to enable or disable polling of certain queues.

From the **Issues** page, it is possible to create a small issue given some input data.

Alternatively, by following the given format in the API documentation for [Create Request](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/service-desk/rest/api-group-request/#api-rest-servicedeskapi-request-post), you can also use an Automation script to set PID 51 with your own JSON data. Make sure, when sending the JSON, that all required fields for the request are included.
