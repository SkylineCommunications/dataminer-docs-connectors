# Evertz 570ITXE-HW-P60

The 570ITXE-HW-P60 is built with modern hardware technology. Leveraging experience in transport stream processing, MPEG and JPEG2000 codecs, the modular ingest encoder with 3G/HD/SD over SDI/IP or IP/ASI MPEG2/H264/J2K inputs enables the building of a content ingest platform for MSO, DTH, IPTV, broadcast and data centers. The device has three distinct processing stages. The input decoder stage supports IP or ASI inputs, with the capacity to decode MPEG2, H.264 or JPEG2000. The processing stage includes audio and video proc, up-/down-/cross-conversion, frame sync and A/V delay. The output encoder stage features H.264 4:2:0 8-bit, H.264 4:2:2 10-bit encoding and SMPTE 2110 input and output controls.

- **Deinterlacer**: Displays controls related to active picture deinterlacing. Deinterlacing is a functional part of the video conversion process that converts interlaced field content into progressive frames. The deinterlacer generates the missing lines that were removed during field capture. It performs interpolation in both the spatial and temporal directions to achieve the optimal estimation of the missing pixels from the original captured video frame. The deinterlacer also utilizes a cadence detection algorithm for the detection of well-known cadences that may be present in the interlaced input signal. If a valid cadence is detected, the original progressive video frame can be extracted from the interlaced input. This results in a perfectly interpolated video signal when producing the progressive output frame.

  It is recommended that all interlaced inputs are deinterlaced. This ensures the highest quality scaling when performing video conversion.

  The subpage displayed by this page button consists of the following sections:

  - **Deinterlacer Status and Controls**: Includes the Mode, Operating Mode, Inverse Telecine and Temporal Noise Reduction Level.

- **Scaler**: The 570ITXE uses high-performance multi-tap polyphase filters to perform scaling and aspect ratio conversion on the input video signal to produce a high-quality scaled output video signal. This subpage allows you to configure sharpness of vertical and horizontal edge transitions, set cut-off frequencies of the polyphase filters, set the RGB background color for unused areas in the output raster and define the default aspect ratio conversion and AFD output code. The subpage consists of the following sections:

  - **Scaler Status**: Displays the Scaler Operating Mode and the Input and Output H and V Start and Stop.
  - **Scaler Controls**: Allows you to configure the Aspect Ratio Conversion, AFD Stamp, H and V Slew Limits and Horizontal and Vertical Filter Cutoffs Frequency parameters.

- **SD Aperture**: The precise definition of the active picture region for an SD video standard is often unclear, because SD signals have been defined differently in various standards. To support varying active picture regions for SD video standards, the 570ITXE module allows you to fully define both the production and clean aperture regions using the SD aperture feature. Both the SD Clean Aperture and the SD Production Aperture can be independently defined with an exact number of pixels and an exact number of lines.

  The SD Aperture subpage consists of the following sections:

  - **SD Aperture Controls**: Allows you to toggle the Aspect Ratio Source.
  - **SD Clean Aperture Controls**: Allows you to set the Clean Aperture of H and V Start and Stop.

    - **Reset Video Proc**: This button allows you to reset all video processing parameters on this subpage to their default value.
    - **RGB Clip**: Allows you to enable or disable the RGB clipping/color legalization process. When this is enabled, the module will clip any illegal levels of R, G, and B (individually) to their respective black and white Levels. When this is disabled, the illegal values are passed unmodified. Usually, the control is set to *Disabled* in order to allow Super Black or other test patterns to pass through the module.
    - **Gain Levels**: These are eight controls that can be used to set the gain of the video. They allow you to adjust the gain of the 3 components in either the YCbCr domain or the RGB domain, over a range of 50 % to 100 % in 0.1 % steps. Gain adjustments in the YCbCr domain are made first, followed by gain adjustments in the RGB domain. Illegal values are clipped after gain adjustments.
    - **DC Offsets**: These are six controls that set the DC offset of the video signal. They allow you to individually adjust the DC offset of Y, Cr and Cb with a range of +/- 200 quantization levels and to individually adjust the DC offset of R, G and B with a range of +/- 200 quantization levels. Offset adjustments in the YCbCr domain are made first, followed by offset adjustments in the RGB domain. Illegal values are clipped after offset adjustments.

  - **Gamma**:

    - The **Gamma Adjust** control enables and disables the gamma adjustment functionality of the 570ITXE module. When this is enabled, you will be able to adjust the gamma level. When this is disabled, the gamma levels are set to 0.
