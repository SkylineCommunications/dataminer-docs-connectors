## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default value: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default value: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product

## How to use

The element created with this connector consists of the following data pages:

- **General**: This page displays information on the Module Status, Supply Voltages and Currents. It contains for example the **LNB Status**, **24V BUC Status**, **TX/RX Amplifier** and **18V PSU1 Status**.
- **Configurations**: On this page, you can configure settings such as the **Polling time**, **RF Power Limits** and **Traps IP Destination** address, as well as **enable or disable traps** on the device.
- **Web Interface**: This page provides access to the web interface of the device. However, note that the client machine has to be able to access the device, as otherwise it will not be possible to open the web interface.
